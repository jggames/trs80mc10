8000 REM JAZSINC JUL 19, 2013
8000 REM THIS MINOTAUR SOUND ROUTINE WON'T MAKE THE MUSIC BETTER BECAUSE IT'S NOT
8000 REM AN INTERRUPT SOUND. I STOPPED MESSING AROUND WITH IT WHEN IT WAS GOOD ENOUGH TO WORK FOR MINOTAUR. LOL.
8000 REM 
8000 REM PROBLEMS WITH THE MC-10 SOUND STATEMENT,
8000 REM 1. IT'S LIMITED. MINOTAUR HAD LOWER NOTES THAN SOUND COULD PLAY.
8000 REM 2. IT'S OUT OF TUNE. EVEN WITH THE NOTE CONVERSION CHART THAT I SAW SOMEWHERE ONLINE (I DON'T REMEMBER WHERE),
8000 REM THE NOTES AREN'T QUITE WHAT THEY SHOULD BE EVEN RELATIVE TO EACH OTHER.
8000 REM 3. IT'S NOT AN INTERRUPT SOUND EITHER
8000 REM 4. DURATION IS DEPENDENT ON FREQUENCY
8000 REM 
8000 REM THE APF MANUAL CAN BE FOUND HERE:
8000 REM HTTP://HCVGM.ORG/APF_MANUALS/APF_CART_MANUALS.HTML
8000 REM IT'S THE MANUAL FOR THE APF BASIC CARTRIDGE. HERE'S A SUMMARY OF WHAT IT SAYS (IT HAS SOME NICE EXAMPLES):
8000 REM 
8000 REM THE NUMBERS 1 THROUGH 7 STAND IN FOR C THROUGH B
8000 REM 1 C
8000 REM 2 D
8000 REM 3 E
8000 REM 4 F
8000 REM 5 G
8000 REM 6 A
8000 REM 7 B
8000 REM TO PLAY AN OCTAVE HIGHER, PUT A * IN FRONT OF THE NUMBER
8000 REM TO PLAY AN OCTAVE LOWER, PUT A / IN FRONT OF THE NUMBER
8000 REM TO PLAY A SHARP, PUT A + IN FRONT OF THE NUMBER
8000 REM TO PLAY A FLAT, PUT A - IN FRONT OF THE NUMBER
8000 REM FOLLOWING A NUMBER WITH A 0 (ZERO) MAKES IT PLAY LONGER
8000 REM A SPACE PUTS A "REST" NON-PLAYING TIME INTO THE MUSIC
