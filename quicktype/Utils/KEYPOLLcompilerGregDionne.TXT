Hi Jim,
I’ve noticed the keyboard issue as well with my setup. This seems to happen even without the compiler. For example, if I enter in LODERUN32.TXT I will often find I cannot move right by pressing “S” without pressing some other key first. It’s not always reproducible though.
I think perhaps for something more reliable that should work in BASIC you can try this instead of PEEK(2) AND PEEK(17023):
PEEK(2) AND MASK AND NOT PEEK(KEYGROUP) using the keygroup and mask shown below:
KEYGROUP	1	2	4	8	16	32
16945		@	H	P	X	0	8
16946		A	I	Q	Y	1	9
16947		B	J	R	Z	2	:*
16948		C	K	S		3	;+
16949		D	L	T		4	,<
16950		E	M	U		5	-=
16951		F	N	V	ENT	6	.>
16952		G	O	W	SPC	7	/?
This should work most of the time even when more than one key is down. Here is sample code to get you started.
5 CLS
10 IF PEEK(2) AND 4 AND NOT PEEK(16952) THEN PRINT@1,"W";
20 IF PEEK(2) AND 1 AND NOT PEEK(16946) THEN PRINT@2,"A";
30 IF PEEK(2) AND 4 AND NOT PEEK(16948) THEN PRINT@3,"S";
40 IF PEEK(2) AND 1 AND NOT PEEK(16949) THEN PRINT@4,"D";
50 IF PEEK(2) AND 32 AND NOT PEEK(16949) THEN PRINT@5,"<";
60 IF PEEK(2) AND 32 AND NOT PEEK(16951) THEN PRINT@6,">";
70 GOTO 5
Try pressing multiple keys at once to get a sense of its limitations.
If this interests you, I can tweak the compiler to support it.
Best,
