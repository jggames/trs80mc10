''The Global Conspiracy
''by Gary Breinholt

''The Illuminati know that true power comes from the subtle application of the Rule of FIW:
''Force Intimidates Influence
''Influence Manipulates Wealth
''Wealth Bribes Force

''Each of these three factions (Force, Influence and Wealth) comprises of two Elements. 
''Control both Elements and you control the Faction.
''The World comprises of nine Regions.
''Exert your power carefully and you will control the Region.
''Claim the most Regions, with the right amount of power, and you will dominate the world.

''But beware: Too much power will overwhelm a Region. This occurs if you control TWO Factions.
''Too much power globally will reveal the Illuminati.

''You and Them will take turms to claim the six Elements, within a Region.
''Tap on an Element to claim it.
''If it is unclaimed it now belongs to you.
''If They beat you to it then Their control is revealed. Your turn is over, but at least you know where They are and maybe can use the information to your benefit.
''Your aim is to claim the Region, according to the Rule of FIW, and to avoid overhwelming Them.

''After all nine Regions have been contested a result is shown.
''Scoring shows the number of Regions held by You and Them and also the amount of Global power:
''1 point per Region + 1 point per overwhelm.
''The Illuminati with the highest score of Regions + Global Power is the winner. Unless the TOTAL Global Power is too high!
