YOU ARE AN IMPORTANT CHARACTER IN THE STORY.
FIRST, ARE YOU MR, MISS, OR MRS? (MS ISN'T APPROPRIATE FOR THE
ERA IN WHICH THE STORY IS SET).                                                     ATHANK YOU.

IT IS WINTER, A FEW YEARS AFTER THE GREAT WAR.
YOU ARE #1 #3 #2, AN AMERICAN
VISITOR TO ENGLAND AND THE GUEST OF THE FAMOUS ENGLISH
DETECTIVE SIR COLIN DROLLERY.  ON THIS PARTICULAR                                                          §
EVENING YOU ARE DINING WITH HIM AT THE EXCLUSIVE
BELLADONNA CLUB IN LONDON.  WITH YOU AT THE TABLE ARE
MAJOR WORMSLEY, LATE OF HIS MAJESTY'S EIGHTH FUSILIERS,
AND A MR BLACKWELL, WHOM LORD COLIN HAS TOLD YOU IS IN
THE FINANCIAL BUSINESS IN           dTHE CITY.
@
OVER AN EXCELLENT FILET DE BOEUF STRASBOURGEOISE
LORD COLIN IS HOLDING FORTH ON HIS FAVORITE SUBJECT, CRIME.

LORD COLIN: STRANGE AS IT SEEMS, YOU'LL FREQUENTLY FIND THAT THECAREFULLY-PLANNED CRIME IS ACTUALLY EASIER TO SOLVE TH            dAN THE
SPUR-OF-THE-MOMENT ONE.

MR BLACKWELL: I CAN'T BELIEVE IT.  WHAT ABOUT THAT BANK JOB
IN THE PAPERS YESTERDAY?  APPARENTLY THE POLICE HAVEN'T A
SINGLE CLUE.  OBVIOUSLY AN EXCEEDINGLY WELL-PLANNED
OPERATION.  i CAN'T BELIEVE THEY'LL EV           ìER CATCH THEM.
@LORD COLIN: WAIT AND SEE.  THESE CAREFUL JOBS HAVE A
CERTAIN PONDEROUS QUALITY, AN UNREMITTING RATIONALITY, IF YOU
WILL, THAT MAKES IT EASY FOR THE POLICE TO PUT THEMSELVES IN
THE MIND OF THE CRIMINAL. THE PROFESSIONAL DETECTIVE       	d AND
THE PROFESSIONAL CRIMINAL THINK MUCH ALIKE.  BUT BEWARE THE
BRILLIANT AMATEUR WHO IMPROVISES AS HE GOES ALONG!

MAJOR WORMSLEY: ACTUALLY I DON'T KNOW WHY ANYONE WOULD TURN
TO CRIME WHEN THERE'S SUCH AN EASY WAY TO GET RICH LEGALLY.

MR           
ç BLACKWELL: YOU MEAN THAT LOTTERY WINNER IN THE PAPERS
TODAY?
@MAJOR WORMSLEY: QUITE SO.

LORD COLIN: BY JOVE!  SOMEONE'S GOING TO BE SWIMMING IN
CHAMPAGNE.  A HUNDRED THOUSAND POUNDS, WAS IT?

MAJOR WORMSLEY: THE HOLDER OF THE WINNING                
dTICKET HASN'T
TURNED UP YET, BUT HE WILL, AS SOON AS HE READS THE PAPERS.

LORD COLIN: INTERESTING DETAIL ABOUT THAT TICKET.  DID YOU
NOTICE THE WINNING NUMBER?

MR BLACKWELL: CAN'T SAY AS I DID.
@LORD COLIN: IT'S THE SAME AS THE NUMBER OF            dTHE CLUB HERE,
PRECEDED BY TWO ZEROS.

MR BLACKWELL: YOU DON'T SAY SO!  REALLY!  ARE YOU QUITE
SURE?

LORD COLIN: NO DOUBT AT ALL.  I LOOKED TWICE TO BE SURE.

MR BLACKWELL: BUT THAT'S EXTRAORDINARY!  MY . . .

MAJOR WORMSLEY: YES?

MR BLAC           
dKWELL: I MEAN, WHAT A COINCIDENCE!
@LORD COLIN: YOU'D BE SURPRISED HOW OFTEN A COINCIDENCE LIKE
THAT TURNS UP.  THINK OF ALL THE HUNDREDS OF NUMBERS YOU HAVE
TO REMEMBER: ADDRESSES, PHONE NUMBERS, STOCK PRICES, DATES--
STATISTICALLY THERE'S           d A GOOD CHANCE THAT ANY NUMBER YOU HEAR
ABOUT WILL MATCH ONE YOU ALREADY KNOW.

MAJOR WORMSLEY: YOU PUT IT SO REASONALBY, LORD COLIN.

MR BLACKWELL: EXCUSE ME GENTLEMEN.  CALL OF NATURE, DON'T
YOU KNOW.  BE RIGHT BACK.

@
THERE IS A PAUSE I           dN THE CONVERSATION AND EVERYONE FALLS TO
THE BEEF AND THE EXCELLENT 1913 CHATEAU DOIGT DE PIED.  YOU
LOOK AROUND THE HUGE OAK-PANELLED DINING HALL.  FIRES CRACKLE
IN MASSIVE STONE FIREPLACES AND A SCORE OF WHITE-JACKETED
SERVANTS MOVE UNOBT           xRUSIVELY AMONG THE TABLES.  YOU RECOGNIZE THEMINISTER OF MARINE, AN ARCHBISHOP, AND TWO MEMBERS OF THE ROYAL
FAMILY.  YOU HAVE COME A LONG WAY FROM #4.

MAJOR WORMSLY: WHAT DO YOU DO BACK IN AMERICA,
#1 #2?

#1 #2:                                     ã
MAJOR WORMSLEY: OH, I SEE.  WELL.

LORD COLIN: #2 HERE IS ALSO AN AMATEUR DETECTIVE
OF SOME RENOWN BACK IN THE STATES.  I WAS HOPING WE'D HAVE
SOME ACTION THAT WOULD BE OF INTEREST TO US, BUT SO FAR ALL
THE CRIMINALS SEEM TO BE LYING LOW             ä(EXCEPT FOR THAT BANK
JOB, WHICH IS REALLY TOO FRIGHTFULLY BORING TO CONTEMPLATE).
@MR BLACKWELL (RETURNING TO THE TABLE): SO--I TRUST YOU
CHAPS HAVE LEFT ME SOME CHATEAU WHATSIS, WHAT?

LORD COLIN: PLENTY MORE WHERE THAT CAME FROM.                   w£I SAY, BLACKWELL, WHAT'S THIS I HEAR ABOUT
YOUR INVESTMENT GROUP?  IN SOME SORT OF FINANCIAL
TROUBLE?
@MR BLACKWELL: NOT AT ALL.  MERELY A TEMPORARY CASH SQUEEZE,
QUITE ROUTINE.  YOU KNOW HOW THESE THINGS GET EXAGGERATED--
ONE TRIES TO MAKE A PERFECT áLY BUSINESSLIKE SHORT-TERM LOAN
AND THE NEXT THING YOU KNOW PEOPLE ARE TALKING BANKRUPTCY,
PESTILENCE AND PERDITION.  ACTUALLY THIS IS A GOOD
TIME TO INVEST IN OUR GROUP, IF YOU'VE GOT A FEW POUNDS.
PROSPECTS WERE NEVER BRIGHTER.
@                    ãMAJOR WORMSLEY: NOT ME, I'M AFRAID.  JUST SCRAPING BY ON
MY PENSION.

A  CLUB STEWARD (APPROACHING THE TABLE): EXCUSE ME,
MR BLACKWELL, SIR, THERE'S A CALL FOR YOU.

MR BLACKWELL: FOR ME?  DID YOU TELL THEM I WAS AT TABLE?

STEWARD: THE PA            óRTY SAID IT WAS URGENT, SIR.

MR BLACKWELL: IN THAT CASE, GENTLEMEN, YOU'LL EXCUSE
ME AGAIN.
@AFTER MR BLACKWELL LEAVES THE TABLE THERE IS
DESULTORY CONVERSATION WHILE THE REMAINS OF THE BEEF ARE
REPLACED BY A SALADE AUX JEUNES PAILLASSON.

MAJOR WO  TRMSLEY: MORE WINE, #1 #2?
[
LORD COLIN: I CAN'T IMAGINE WHY YOU'RE INTERESTED IN
THE CAR.  IT HAS NO BEARING ON THE CASE WHATSOEVER.

#1 #2: NO, MY LORD.                                                                                                  dMAJOR WORMSLEY: HITTING IT PRETTY HEAVY TONIGHT,
AREN'T YOU, #1 #2?  GOT TO WATCH IT.
WREAKS HAVOC ON THE OLD LIVER, DON'T YOU KNOW.@
[MAJOR WORMSLEY: DON'T TELL ME YOU'RE ONE OF THESE AMERICAN
PROHIBITIONISTS.  WHY, THEY'LL BE THE DOWNFALL           ~ OF
CIVILIZATION AS WE KNOW IT.@[YES, THE ROOM IS COLD.  THAT CONTRADICTS
YOUR HYPOTHESIS THAT RODNEY WAS KILLED AT BREAKFAST.                                                                                                                             dLORD COLIN: DON'T MIND OLD WORMSLEY, #2.  HE'S A BIT OF
A BUG ON THE SUBJECT OF ALCOHOL.  WELL, WELL.  HERE'S OUR
BUSY FINANCIER BACK AGAIN.

MR BLACKWELL TAKES HIS SEAT AT THE TABLE.  HE APPEARS
FLUSHED AND EXCITED.

LORD COLIN: WHAT IS IT           d, BLACKWELL?
@MR BLACKWELL: IT'S MY GOOD-FOR-NOTHING NEPHEW RODNEY.  CLAIMED
OVER THE PHONE HE WAS GOING TO KILL HIMSELF IF I DIDN'T LEND
HIM 500 QUID.  I REFUSED, OF COURSE, AND THERE WAS THE SOUND
OF A SHOT--QUITE DEAFENED ME--AND THE LIN           dE WENT DEAD.

LORD COLIN: GOOD HEAVENS!  SHOULDN'T WE BE GETTING ON OVER
THERE?  I MEAN . . .
@MR BLACKWELL: NO, NO--THE WHOLE THING'S AN ACT RODNEY'S
PUTTING ON, JUST RAGGING ME.  HE'S DONE THIS SORT OF THING
BEFORE, THREATENING ME WITH ON           dE THING AND ANOTHER, TRYING
TO GET MONEY OUT OF ME.  HE'S QUITE AN ACTOR, AND ABSOLUTELY
DOESN'T CARE WHAT HE DOES TO OTHER PEOPLE'S FEELINGS.  MAKES ME
DAMN MAD, IF YOU WANT TO KNOW, HIS TRYING TO USE PEOPLE THIS
WAY.

MAJOR WORMSLEY: YOU            dDON'T THINK THIS TIME HE COULD HAVE
BEEN SERIOUS?

MR BLACKWELL: NOT A CHANCE.  IT'S A TYPICAL RODNEY PLOY.
@#1 #2: YOUR NEPHEW SOUNDS LIKE WHAT
WE CALL A ROTTEN KID, BACK IN #4.

MR BLACKWELL: EXACTLY SO.  ROTTEN TO THE CORE.  HE THOUGHT
O           dF HIMSELF AS AN ARTIST AT ONE TIME, BUT NOW HE'S GIVEN UP
ALL PRETENSE OF THAT AND SPENDS HIS TIME GAMBLING AND GOING
AFTER THE LADIES.  DEPRESSING SUBJECT, RODNEY IS.  LET'S
DROP HIM.
@MAJOR WORMSLEY: I SAY, THEN.  ANYONE FOR A HAND OF BRI            ADGE?

MR BLACKWELL: CAPITAL IDEA, WORMSLEY.  DO YOU
PLAY, #1 #2?
                                                                                                                                                                                          "LORD COLIN: THAT'S ALL RIGHT, OLD CHAP.  DON'T FEEL BAD.  YOU
CAN BE DUMMY.
[LORD COLIN: SMASHING.  i'LL PARTNER YOU AND WE'LL CUT THEM
TO RIBBONS.
                                                                                                       d@THE PARTY RETIRES UPSTAIRS TO THE GAMING ROOM.  THE PLAY IS
LIVELY AND THE STAKES ARE HIGH ENOUGH TO BE INTERSTING.  WHEN
YOU NEXT LOOK AT YOUR WATCH IT IS AFTER THREE. 

#1 #2: I DON'T WANT TO BE A WET BLANKET,
BUT DO YOU FELLOWS REALIZE            #óWHAT TIME IT IS?

MR BLACKWELL: GOOD HEAVENS--I HAVE TO BE AT THE OFFICE EARLY.

MAJOR WORMSLEY: TIME FOR ME TO TURN IN AS WELL.  CAN'T KEEP
LATE HOURS THE WAY I COULD WHEN I WAS A SUBALTERN.
NIGHTO!  (HE TODDLES OFF TO HIS ROOM).
@LORD COLIN: CHEER  $dIO.  DROP YOU AT YOUR PLACE, BLACKWELL?
SAVE YOU TAXI FARE.

MR BLACKWELL: OH, RATHER.  THANKS.
@THE THREE OF YOU RETRIEVE YOUR COATS AND STEP OUT OF THE
CLUB INTO THE NIGHT.  IT IS BITTERLY COLD AND A LIGHT SNOW
IS FALLING, THE FLAKES TWIN           %dKLING IN THE LIGHT
OF THE GAS LAMPS.  LORD COLIN'S HISPANA-SUIZA WHISKS 
MR BLACKWELL TO HIS COMFORTABLE HOME IN KENSINGTON, THEN HEADS
FOR MUMBLES, LORD COLIN'S FAMILY ESTATE.  YOU ARE VERY TIRED BY
THE TIME YOU ARRIVE AND NEED ONLY A FEW            &dMOMENTS TO FALL INTO A
DEEP SLUMBER IN THE OPULENT FOUR-POSTER IN LORD COLIN'S
GUESTROOM.
@YOU ARE AWAKENED WHAT SEEMS LIKE ONLY A FEW MINUTES LATER, BUT
THERE IS PALE WINTER SUNLIGHT IN THE ROOM AND A GLANCE AT YOUR
WATCH SHOWS IT IS AFTER           'v EIGHT.

LORD COLIN (SHAKING YOU GENTLY): WAKE UP!  UP!  YOU ARE THE
SOUNDEST SLEEPER I'VE EVER SEEN.  SAY SOMETHING!
                                                                                                                                     ¯DO GET UP.  BLACKWELL IS DOWNSTAIRS, SAYS HE CAN'T RAISE
RODNEY ON THE PHONE.  HE'S WORRIED, ALL OF A SUDDEN.  WANT'S
US TO GO ROUND WITH HIM IN CASE THERE'S BEEN ANY TROUBLE.@                                                                           )d#1 #2 (SITTING UP): YOU MEAN HE THINKS
RODNEY MIGHT ACTUALLY HAVE KILLED HIMSELF?

LORD COLIN: ALL HE KNOWS IS HE CAN'T GET HIM ON THE PHONE.
PROBABLY NOTHING TO IT, BUT A BRISK DRIVE AROUND LONDON WILL
AT LEAST WAKE US UP.  EARLY TO BED, E           *dARLY TO RISE,
AND ALL THAT ROT.  I'LL WAIT FOR YOU DOWNSTAIRS.
@YOU DRESS AND HURRY OUTSIDE.  IT IS, IF ANYTHING, EVEN COLDER
THAN THE NIGHT BEFORE, BUT THE SKY IS CLEAR.  YOUR BOOTS SQUEEK
IN THE NEW-FALLEN SNOW.
CLIMBING INTO THE HISPANA-           +dSUIZA YOU NOTICE THAT MR BLACKWELL
LOOKS SOMEWHAT HAGGARD.

#1 #2: STARTED TO WORRY ABOUT HIM AFTER ALL, EH?
@MR BLACKWELL: WELL, YES, RATHER.  ACTUALLY I'M SURE HE'S ALL
RIGHT, BUT I COULDN'T SLEEP ANYWAY SO I CALLED HIM THIS MORNING
AND C           ,dOULDN'T GET HIM.  NOW THAT'S ODD, BECAUSE HE'S A BIT
OF AN INSOMNIAC--HAS TROUBLE GOING TO SLEEP--AND GENERALLY
DOESN'T GET UP UNTIL LATE.  SO I'D EXPECT HIM TO BE IN, YOU
KNOW, AT EIGHT OR SO WHEN I CALLED.

LORD COLIN: TELL ME ABOUT HIM--           -dWHAT HE DOES, AND SO FORTH.
@MR BLACKWELL: RODNEY?  NOT MUCH TO TELL--HE DOESN'T DO MUCH,
EXCEPT GAMBLE AND WOMANIZE.  BIG CHAP, BUSHY RED BEARD,
PLAYED RUGBY IN SCHOOL BUT HE'S QUITE GONE TO SEED NOW.
BECOME A REGULAR BOHEMIAN.  HE MAKES A           .d TINY BIT OF MONEY
DOING ODD JOBS.  HE'S POOR AS A CHURCHMOUSE, BUT ALWAYS
HOPING FOR THAT BIG STRIKE GAMBLING.  LIVES ALONE IN THIS
SQUALID FLAT--I SAW IT ONCE A YEAR OR SO AGO AND NEVER WENT
BACK--NOT MY CUP OF TEA.

THE BIG CAR WENDS ITS           /d WAY THROUGH A DINGY INDUSTRIAL SECTION
OF EAST LONDON AND FINALLY, AT MR BLACKWELL'S INSTRUCTIONS,
PULLS UP AT AN OLD FACTORY BUILDING.
@MR BLACKWELL: THE FACTORY IS ABANDONED NOW, BUT HE LETS A
ROOM ON TOP--AN OLD OFFICE.  NOT A SOUL AROU           0dND--THAT'S RATHER
WHAT WORRIES ME.  THERE'S NO ONE TO HELP, IF ANYTHING HAPPENED.

HE LEADS YOU UP A NARROW STAIRWAY TO A LANDING LIT BY A SINGLE
ELECTRIC BULB.  HE KNOCKS ON A DOOR ON WHICH THE FADED WORD
"PRIVATE" CAN STILL BE MADE OUT.             1£THERE IS NO SOUND BEYOND THE
DOOR.

LORD COLIN: LET ME TRY. (HE HAMMERS ON THE DOOR).  RODNEY!
ARE YOU THERE!  (THERE IS NO ANSWER).  WE'LL BREAK IT DOWN,
THEN.

WITH SOME DIFFICULTY YOU HELP HIM TO KICK OPEN THE DOOR.@THE ONE-ROOM FLAT (PAY ATTENTIO 2îN!) IS MESSY
AND DISHEVELED.  LIGHT FILTERS IN THE DIRTY
WINDOWS, ONE OF WHICH IS SLIGHTLY OPEN.
THERE IS A RUMPLED BED AND A RUDIMENTARY KITCHEN: ONE GAS
BURNER, SOME SHELVES WITH A FEW ITEMS OF FOOD (BEANS, SUGAR),
AND A GARBAGE CAN.  ON THE WA     3ãLL IS AN OLD-FASHIONED CRANK
TELEPHONE.  THERE IS A SMALL COAL STOVE, AND YOU IMAGINE THAT
IN COLD WEATHER RODNEY HAD TO GET UP AT LEAST ONCE IN THE NIGHT
TO REFUEL IT.
@BUT RODNEY WILL NOT BE GETTING UP EVER AGAIN.  HE SITS
SLUMPED OVER T            4£HE ROOM'S ONLY TABLE, HIS HEAD RESTING IN A PUDDLEOF SPILLED COFFEE, BESIDE THE REMAINS OF A MEAL.  THERE IS A
REVOLVER IN HIS HAND AND A SMALL HOLE IN THE SIDE OF HIS HEAD, 
OUT OF WHICH AN OCCASIONAL DROP OF BLOOD STILL TRICKLES.
YOU NOTICE A SMALL 5£ PIECE OF FUZZY BROWN MATERIAL CAUGHT ON A
SPLINTERY PART OF THE TABLE LEG NEAR THE FLOOR.
ON THE TABLE NEAR THE DEAD MAN IS A NOTE.
YOU SHIVER, NOT ONLY FROM THE SIGHT OF THE BODY.  IT IS ALMOST
AS COLD IN THE FLAT AS IT IS OUTSIDE.
@LORD COLIN: RAT 6£HER A DISTRESSING SIGHT TO COME ACROSS SO EARLY
IN THE MORNING, WHAT?  POOR RODNEY. WELL, IT CERTAINLY LOOKS
LIKE AN OPEN AND SHUT SUICIDE, BUT IN CASE THERE'S AN ENQUIRY
WE HAD BETTER GO OVER THE PLACE A BIT, WHILE THE CLUES ARE
FRESH.  I SAY, #2, W 7£HY DON'T YOU HAVE
A GO AT IT?  SEE WHAT YOU CAN FIGURE OUT--VERIFY THAT IT'S
A SUICIDE, OR WHATEVER.

#1 #2: THAT'S VERY GENEROUS OF YOU, LORD
COLIN.  I ACCEPT.

LORD COLIN: JOLLY GOOD.  FIRST, IS THERE ANYTHING YOU'D LIKE
A BETTER LOOK AT?  THE BED, zOWHAT ELSE DO YOU WANT TO LOOK AT?[WANT TO LOOK AT SOMETHING ELSE?[SEE ANYTHING ELSE YOU WANT TO EXAMINE?[ANYTHING ELSE YOU WANT TO LOOK AT?[ANYTHING ELSE LOOK INTERESTING?[IS THERE ANYTHING ELSE YOU'D LIKE TO SEE?                                      ¶NO, BLACKWELL DIDN'T HAVE TIME TO KILL RODNEY
DURING DINNER.  RODNEY'S FLAT IS MUCH TOO FAR AWAY TO REACH
DURING THE TEN MINUTES OR SO BLACKWELL WAS AWAY FROM THE
TABLE.
                                                                                 ÉAFRAID I DON'T UNDERSTAND.[CAN'T FOLLOW YOU, OLD SPORT.[I DON'T UNDERSTAND.[I CAN'T UNDERSTAND YOU.[SORRY, I DON'T UNDERSTAND.[DON'T FOLLOW YOU, I'M AFRAID.[I WISH I UNDERSTOOD YOU.[DON'T HAVE A CLUE WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO SAY.                         ï
YOU PICK UP THE NOTE FROM THE TABLE.  THERE IS A SMUDGED BLOODY
THUMB-PRINT IN THE UPPER LEFT-HAND CORNER.  THE NOTE READS:
"I AM BROKE, I NEVER WIN AT GAMBLING, AND MY USELESS AND
DISPICABLE LIFE HAS GROWN BORING, SO I AM ABOUT TO END IT AL         <PL.
SOMEONE ELSE CAN WASH UP MY SUPPER DISHES!  HAR, HAR."
IT IS SIGNED "RODNEY."                                                                                                                                                                           §
YOU NOTICED WHEN YOU FIRST ENTERED THE FLAT THAT THE RECEIVER
WAS HUNG UP ON THE HOOK IN THE USUAL WAY.  YOU PICK IT UP NOW
OUT OF CURIOSITY, AND AFTER A MOMENT THE OPERATOR INQUIRES,
"NUMBER PLEASE?"  YOU HANG UP.  THE TELEPHONE IS APPAREN          >[TLY
WORKING NORMALLY.[PLEASE DON'T BE FLIPPANT, #5.  THE SITUATION
IS TOO GRAVE FOR LEVITY.                                                                                                                                                                a
YOU PUSH OPEN THE WINDOW.  DIRECTLY BELOW IT IS A FIRE-ESCAPE.
THERE IS A FAINT OUTLINE OF FOOTSTEPS LEADING DOWN TOWARD THE
GROUND, BUT THEY ARE QUITE INDISTINCT  AND NO
DETAILS OF THE SHOE SIZE ETC CAN BE MADE OUT.  YOU STEP                        @A OUT 
ONTO THE FIRE-ESCAPE AND FOLLOW THE PRINTS DOWN TO THE GROUND
AND THROUGH A NARROW ALLEY BACK TO THE STREET, BUT THERE YOU
LOSE THEM.  YOU REJOIN LORD COLIN AND MR BLACKWELL IN THE FLAT.                                                           d
MR BLACKWELL: IT'S MY GUN--MY OLD SERVICE REVOLVER.
RODNEY ASKED ME FOR IT A YEAR OR MORE AGO--SAID HE WAS
FRIGHTENED, LIVING SO FAR FROM EVERYTHING.  I'D NEVER HAVE
GIVEN IT TO HIM, OF COURSE, IF I'D HAD ANY IDEA HE WAS CAPABLE
OF HARMING           B= HIMSELF.[
BLACWELL'S COAT APPEARS UNREMARKABLE IN EVERY WAY.                                                                                                                                                                                              d
MR BLACKWELL: AFTER YOU DROPPED ME OFF AT MY HOUSE I WENT
RIGHT TO BED AND TO SLEEP.  SOMETHING MADE ME WAKE UP A LITTLE
AFTER DAWN, THOUGH, AND I STARTED TO THINK ABOUT RODNEY'S CALL.
I WASN'T SERIOUSLY CONCERNED, BUT I THOUGHT I'D JUST R           DING HIM UPAND THEN MAYBE I'D BE ABLE TO GET BACK TO SLEEP.  BUT THERE WAS
NO ANSWER, SO I TOOK A CAB STRAIGHT OVER TO YOUR PLACE.  THE
REST YOU KNOW.                                                                                                      ôWELL, THEN, ARE YOU FAIRLY WELL CONVINCED

THE MEAL ON THE TABLE CONSISTS OF A SINGLE PLATE OF BEANS.
THERE IS ALSO A HALF-FILLED COFFEE CUP AND THE POT, WHICH HAS
UPSET, SPILLING COFFEE OVER THE FLAT WOODEN SURFACE OF THE
TABLE.  RODNEY'S RED BEARD RESTS IN THE SPILLED LIQUID.
THE           IURE ARE ALSO SALT AND PEPPER SHAKERS AND A SMALL SUGAR BOWL.

CARDBOARD COULD BE, LORD COLIN?
@LORD COLIN: LOOKS VERY MUCH TO ME LIKE PART OF A LOTTERY

THE COAL STOVE IS A SMALL ONE, CAPABLE OF HOLDING FUEL FOR AT
MOST HALF THE NIGHT.  YOU OPEN THE LITTLE IRON DOOR AND TO YOUR
SURPRISE FIND THAT THE STOVE IS STILL SOMEWHAT WARM, ALTHOUGH
THE ROOM IS COLD.  MORE SURPRISING IS THE FACT THAT           Nh THE STOVE
CONTAINS ALMOST A FULL LOAD OF COAL, AND THAT THE ASHES BENEATH
THE COAL FEEL DAMP AND SOGGY.                                                                                                                                                   p

THE WOUND IS A TYPICAL BULLET-WOUND, CONSISTANT WITH THE SIZE OFTHE WEAPON USED.  THERE ARE FAINT POWDER-BURNS ON THE SKIN

MR BLACKWELL: OH, I SAY, THIS IS GOING TOO FAR!  I'M NOT GOING
TO LET YOU SEARCH ME AS IF I WERE A COMMON CRIMINAL.

CARDBOARD) WHAT HAVE            UÿWE HERE!

MR BLACKWELL: HERE! GIVE ME THAT!
@LORD COLIN: BLESS MY SOUL--IT'S THE WINNING LOTTERY TICKET!

THE TORN EDGE OF THE LOTTERY TICKET EXACTLY MATCHES THE
FRAGMENT OF GRAY CARDBOARD CLENCHED IN RODNEY'S HAND.[
THE LOTTERY TICKET IS MADE OF GRAY CARDBOARD.  THE EDGE
IS TORN.                                                                           ¯WELL THEN, BACK TO THE OLD DRAWING BOARD, WHAT?[NO--I HAD NO MOTIVE, AND THERE ARE TOO MANY
CLUES POINTING IN ANOTHER DIRECTION.  I'M AFRAID YOU'LL HAVE TO
DO BETTER THAN THAT.                                                                           £AH, HA!  AN INTRIGUING HYPOTHESIS, BUT HOW
DO YOU EXPLAIN THAT THE EVIDENCE POINTS TO RODNEY'S HAVING BEEN
KILLED OVER HIS SUPPER LAST NIGHT, WHILE WE KNOW INDISPUTABLY
THAT BLACKWELL WAS WITH US UNTIL EARLY THIS MORNING?
BLACKWELL COULD NOT, PRESUMA ˝xNO, I DON'T THINK ANYONE ELSE WAS INVOLVED.
IN FACT, FROM THE EVIDENCE I'VE SEEN, I'D SAY THE MURDERER
WAS IN THIS ROOM.                                                                                                                                   ÆVERY GOOD!  I'M INCLINED TO AGREE WITH YOU--
RODNEY WAS NOT KILLED LAST NIGHT AT ALL, BUT SOMETIME THIS
MORNING.  BUT WHAT EVIDENCE DO YOU HAVE TO SUPPORT THAT
HYPOTHESIS?                                                                                NO, I DON'T THINK BLACKWELL HIRED ANYONE
OR HAD ANY CONFEDERATES.
[SO YOU'RE MAKING ACCUSATIONS UNSUPPORTED
BY THE FACTS, EH?  BETTER BE MORE OBSERVANT FROM NOW ON.                                                                                       ·MAJOR WORMSLEY?  NO, NO, THAT'S LAUGHABLE!
POOR WORMSLEY'S EIGHTY IF HE'S A DAY, AND HE NEVER LEAVES THE
CLUB.  HE HAS NO MOTIVE, AND THERE'S NO EVIDENCE POINTING TO
HIM.  YOU COULD JUST AS EASILY ACCUSE THE PRIME MINISTER!                            ãQUITE SO!  THE SPILLED COFFEE WASN'T FROZEN.
IF RODNEY HAD BEEN KILLED AT SUPPERTIME THE COAL STOVE WOULLD
HAVE GONE OUT HALF-WAY THROUGH THE NIGHT AND EVERYTHING IN THE
FLAT WOULD HAVE FROZEN.  RODNEY'S BEARD WOULD HAVE BEEN
FROZEN TO THE            ^ TABLE BY THE SPILLED COFFEE.                                                                                                                                                                                                                              I
BLACKWELL: IF YOU THINK I'M GOING TO WRITE SOMETHING FOR YOU
AFTER YOUR LIBELOUS INSINUATIONS THEN THINK AGAIN.

LORD COLIN: BUT WHAT DO YOU ALREADY HAVE, #2,
WITH HIS HANDWRITING ON IT?

#1 #2: AHH. . .                                               íYES--RODNEY MUST HAVE DIED INSTANTLY,
SO HOW COULD HE HAVE GOTTEN HIS BLOOD ON THE SUICIDE NOTE?
ONE CAN SAFELY ASSUME THAT SOMEONE ELSE TOUCHED THE NOTE AFTER
HE DIED--AND PERHAPS WROTE IT AS WELL.                                                     cIT'S CERTAINLY LIKELY THAT IF RODNEY HAD
BEEN KILLED AT SUPPERTIME HIS BLOOD WOULD HAVE HAD TIME TO
COAGULATE AND THE WOUND WOULD NOT STILL BE DRIPPING.  GOOD
POINT, #2.                                                                                  AVERY CURIOUS INDEED.  RODNEY IS POOR,
SO IT IS UNLIKELY HE WOULD THROW AWAY PERFECTLY GOOD FOOD.
BUT IF SOMEONE WANTED TO MAKE IT LOOK AS IF SUPPER RATHER THAN
BREAKFAST WAS HIS LAST MEAL . . .                                                          >IT IS RATHER ODD, ISN'T IT?
WHY WOULD THE ASHES BE WET AND THE STOVE STILL WARM, UNLESS
SOMEONE HAD DELIBERATELY PUT OUT THE FIRE, AND FAIRLY
RECENTLY TOO?                                                                                                UWHAT OTHER EVIDENCE DO YOU HAVE THAT BLACKWELL
KILLED HIM THIS MORNING?[DO YOU HAVE ANY OTHER REASON TO THINK
BLACKWELL KILLED HIM OVER BREAKFAST?[WHAT OTHER EVIDENCE POINTS TO
BLACKWELL HAVING KILLED HIM THIS MORNING?                                 yI THINK YOU'LL NEED MORE EVIDENCE TO
CONVINCE A JURY BLACKWELL REALLY KILLED HIM, SO BACK
TO THE OLD DRAWING BOARD, WHAT?                                                                                                                                  UTHE UNLOCKED WINDOW AND THE FOOTPRINTS
IN THE SNOW LEADING DOWN TO THE STREET CERTAINLY EXPLAIN HOW
SOMEONE COULD HAVE LEFT THE FLAT DESPITE THE DOOR'S BEING
BOLTED ON THE INSIDE.  PITY THE PRINTS AREN'T MORE DISTINCT.                                 dYOU SLIPPED UP BADLY THERE, BLACKWELL.
YOU CLAIMED TO HAVE HEARD THE SHOT OVER THE PHONE, YET THE
RECEIVER IS HUNG UP AND AND RODNEY ISN'T EVEN NEAR IT.
ONE DOES NOT HANG UP THE PHONE, STROLL ACROSS THE ROOM AND
SEAT ONESELF AT THE SUPPER T           h5ABLE WHEN ONE IS SHOT THROUGH
THE TEMPLE.[ALL RIGHT.
                                                                                                                                                                                                      ´BLACKWELL DENIED IT LAST NIGHT, BUT THE RUMOR
IS THAT HIS FIRM IS IN FINANCIAL TROUBLE.  IF THAT
PROVES TO BE TRUE IT CERTAINLY PROVIDES A REASON FOR HIM TO
WANT TO OBTAIN SOME READY MONEY.                                                              dYES--I WAS ALSO IMPRESEED AT BLACKWELL'S
OBVIOUS AMAZEMENT WHEN I TOLD HIM THE WINNING NUMBER.  MORE
AMAZEMENT, I THOUGHT, THAN COULD BE ACCOUNTED FOR BY THE MERE
COINCIDENCE OF THE THING.  DOESN'T PROVE ANYTHING, OF COURSE,
BUT IT IS RATHE           k8R SUGGESTIVE--I'M SURE RODNEY HAD SHOWED HIM THE
TICKET.                                                                                                                                                                                                   ›
THE COFFEE SPILLED ON THE TABLE IS NO LONGER WARM, BUT NEITHER
IS IT FROZEN, AS ONE MIGHT EXPECT IF IT HAD BEEN LYING IN THE
FLAT FOR HOURS AFTER THE STOVE WENT OUT.                                                                                     dVERY DAMNING EVIDENCE.  THE TORN TICKET
INDICATES EITHER A STRUGGLE OVER THE TICKET WHILE RODNEY WAS
ALIVE OR THAT BLACKWELL RIPPED IT FROM HIS STIFFINED FINGERS
AFTER HE DIED (I'D GUESS THE LATTER).  IN ANY CASE THAT SINGLE
CLUE WILL ITSEL           n.F GO A LONG WAY TOWARD BLACKWELL'S CONVICTION.                                                                                                                                                                                                             AVERY IMPORTANT EVIDENCE.  WE KNOW FROM THE
DIARY THAT RODNEY HAD THE LOTTERY TICKET AND THAT BLACKWELL
KNEW ABOUT IT.  NOW BLACKWELL HAS THE TICKET AND RODNEY IS
DEAD.  THE CONCLUSION IS OBVIOUS.                                                        rYES--IT'S HARD TO IMAGINE A GUILTLESS
REASON FOR WANTING TO WRITE ANOTHER MAN'S SUICIDE NOTE.
BUT IT'S EASY TO UNDERSTAND HOW ONE WOULD WANT TO TURN 
A MURDER INTO A SUICIDE.                                                                             dDOESN'T MAKE SENSE, DOES IT?
A MAN WITH INSOMNIA, AS BLACKWELL SAID RODNEY HAD, WOULD SURELY
STEER CLEAR OF COFFEE IN THE EVENING.  HE COULD WELL DRINK IT ATBREAKFAST, THOUGH, TO GET GOING IN THE MORNING AFTER A HARD
NIGHT.  SUGGESTS RODNEY           r' WAS KILLED OVER BREAKFAST, DOESN'T IT?                                                                                                                                                                                                                    ≠I'M NOT SURE WHOM YOU'RE TALKING

ONE OF THE NEWSPAPERS IS THIS MORNING'S EDITION.  THERE IS
NO MENTION IN ANY OF THE PAPERS OF THE WINNING LOTTERY NUMBER,
ALTHOUGH ALL THE PAPERS LOOK AS IF THEY HAD BEEN WELL READ.                                                                     +YES--IF RODNEY HAD BEEN KILLED LAST NIGHT

THE FRAGMENT OF GRAY CARDBOARD CLUTCHED IN RODNEY'S HAND,
BESIDES APPEARING TO BE (AS LORD COLIN SAID) PART OF A
LOTTERY TICKET, YIELDS (BY ITSELF) NO NEW INFORMATION.                                                                                   1IF RODNEY WAS IN FACT MURDERED THEN YOU'VE
SHOWN THAT BLACKWELL MUST HAVE DONE IT.  BUT I THINK THERE'S
A LOT MORE EVIDENCE THAT PROVES IT WASN'T A SUICIDE.  CARE TO
GIVE ME AN EXAMPLE?                                                                  WHAT OTHER EVIDENCE SHOWS THAT RODNEY
WAS MURDERED?[WHAT ELSE POINTS TO RODNEY'S HAVING
BEEN MURDERED?[CAN YOU THINK OF ANY OTHER EVIDENCE
THAT RODNEY WAS MURDERED?                                                                                       UYOU HAVE ENOUGH EVIDENCE NOW TO SHOW THAT
RODNEY WAS MURDERED, BUT I DON'T THINK YOU'VE REALLY PROVED
THAT BLACKWELL HAD TO BE THE MURDERER.  CAN YOU THINK OF ANY
EVIDENCE THAT SPECIFICALLY TIES BLACKWELL TO THE CRIME?                                 ÖBUT YOU NEED TO SHOW IT HAD TO BE BLACKWELL.
HERE'S A HINT--IF PART OF THE LOTTERY TICKET WAS FOUND CLENCHED
IN THE VICTIM'S HAND (YOU DID LOOK AT THE BODY, DIDN'T YOU?),
THEN WHERE'S THE REST OF IT?  PRETTY OBVIOUS, REALLY.                           BUT YOU STILL HAVEN'T PROVED IT WAS BLACKWELL.
ANOTHER HINT--IN WHOSE HAND WAS THE SUICIDE NOTE WRITTEN?
DO YOU HAVE AN EXAMPLE OF BLACKWELL'S HANDWRITING?
THINK BACK.                                                                                    IHOWEVER, YOU STILL HAVEN'T NAILED BLACKWELL.
A THIRD HINT: WHERE DID THE TORN PIECE OF FUZZY MATERIAL ON
THE SPLINTERY PART OF THE TABLE LEG COME FROM?  PERHAPS
SOMEONE IN A HURRY BRUSHED AGAINST THE TABLE.                                             âTHEN--WHAT EVIDENCE PROVES BLACKWELL DID IT?[NOW--TELL ME THE PROOF THAT BLACKWELL KILLED HIM.[SO--WHAT EVIDENCE SHOWS IT HAD TO BE BLACKWELL?[YES--AND HOW DO YOU CONCLUDE THAT BLACKWELL DID IT?[THEN--HOW DO YOU PROVE BLACKWELL DID IT?                ÊHOW I RECONSTRUCT THE CASE.
@AS WE LEARNED FROM RODNEY'S DIARY (YOU DID READ
THE DIARY, DIDN'T YOU?) BLACKWELL ALREADY KNEW THAT RODNEY HAD
A LOTTERY TICKET AND WHAT ITS NUMBER WAS.                                                                      z®BUT YOU NEED MORE EVIDENCE, #2. BE OBSERVANT![WELL, YOU STILL NEED MORE EVIDENCE.
BETTER FIND SOME MORE CLUES.[THE JURY WON'T BE CONVINCED BY WHAT YOU HAVE
SO FAR, #2. BETTER FIND MORE PROOF.                                                            ,STILL NOT ENOUGH EVIDENCE, I'M AFRAID.
CAN'T YOU FIND SOME MORE CLUES?[YOU'LL JUST HAVE TO COME UP WITH SOME
MORE CLUES, OLD CHAP.                                                                                                                         úINDEED SO.  I CAN'T IMAGINE WHY RODNEY WOULD
PUT A FALSE ENTRY IN HIS DIARY, SO IT SEEMS LIKELY THAT
BLACKWELL LIED WHEN HE SAID HE HADN'T BEEN UP HERE FOR A YEAR.                                                                                        IWHAT WE NEED HERE, #2, IS A COMPLETE
SENTENCE, SOMETHING LIKE "THE DOUCHESS WAS WEARING THE
CONSTABLE'S HAT."  THAT'S FROM A DIFFERENT STORY, BUT YOU GET
THE IDEA.  ONE-WORD ANSWERS DON'T EXPLAIN ANYTHING.                                              åAGAIN I DON'T UNDERSTAND YOU.  I SAY, #2,
IF YOU THINK, FOR EXAMPLE, THAT POOR RODNEY WASN'T REALLY
KILLED AT SUPPERTIME, THEN YOU CAN SAY JUST THAT, OR TELL US
WHEN HE WAS KILLED.  THAT'S THE SORT OF EXPLANATION WE'RE
LOOKING FOR.  NOW,              |YOU THINK YOU DID IT?  YOU'RE CONFESSING?
COME ON, #2, TRY TO BE A BIT MORE SERIOUS.
YOU KNOW YOU HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH IT.                                                                                                                               ô
AS SOON AS HE FOUND OUT, DURING DINNER, THAT THE WINNING NUMBER
WAS THE SAME AS RODNEY'S, HIS MIND BEGAN WORKING--NO DOUBT
ENCOURAGED BY WHAT I HAD FOOLISHLY BEEN SAYING ABOUT THE
ADVANTAGES OF AMATEUR CRIMINALS.
                                     YdHE EXCUSED HIMSELF FOR A "CALL OF NATURE;" ACTUALLY HE RANG UP
RODNEY AND TOLD HIM TO CALL HIM BACK AT THE CLUB IN TEN MINUTES.PROBABLY TOLD HIM THERE WOULD BE MONEY IN IT, DIDN'T
YOU, BLACKWELL?
@MR BLACKWELL: YOU SWINE, LORD COLIN.

LORD            ˇãCOLIN: TEMPER, TEMPER.  THEN OF COURSE YOU FABRICATED THAT
MARVELOUS STORY OF THE SHOT THAT WAS FIRST A JOKE AND THEN A
SUICIDE.  RATHER IMAGINITIVE, BLACKWELL.
REALLY I'M SURPRISED YOU HAD IT IN YOU.

MR BLACKWELL: NO ONES'S EVER APPRECIA            ≠dTED MY TALANTS.
@LORD COLIN: A JURY CAN DO SOME APPRECIATING NOW, OLD SPORT.
SO OF COURSE RODNEY ACTUALLY SAID NOTHING TO YOU EXCEPT
"HELLO, WHAT'S IT ALL ABOUT?"  BUT YOU WERE NO DOUBT MYSTERIOUS
AND SAID YOU'D SEE HIM IN THE MORNING.

AND           õ§ SO YOU DID, SNEAKING IN HIS UNLOCKED DOOR AND BLOWING
HIS BRAINS OUT AS HE SAT OVER HIS EGGS AND SAUSAGE.
@THEN THE CHALLENGE: HOW TO MAKE IT LOOK AS IF HE HAD BEEN
KILLED THE NIGHT BEFORE, SO AS TO PROVIDE YOU WITH A PERFECT
ALIBI.

IF HE           údHAD BEEN KILLED AT DINNER THE STOVE WOULD HAVE GONE OUT
AND THE ROOM WOULD HAVE BEEN COLD.  SO YOU PUT OUT THE FIRE WITHWATER (HENCE THE WET ASHES) AND OPENED THE WINDOW.  YOU DUMPED
HIS BREAKFAST IN THE GARBAGE AND COOKED UP SOME BEANS TO            dLOOK
LIKE DINNER--BUT YOU MADE THE MISTAKE OF LEAVING THE COFFEE ON
THE TABLE, WHICH RODNEY WOULD NOT HAVE DRUNK FOR DINNER BECAUSE
OF HIS INSOMNIA.
@YOU WROTE A BOGUS SUICIDE NOTE, NOT EVEN THINKING TO DISGUISE
YOUR HANDWRITING, AND MANAGE           ù£D TO GET YOUR BLOODY THUMB-PRINT ON
IT AND, IN YOUR HASTE, TO TEAR YOUR TROUSERS ON THE TABLE-LEG.
YOU FORGOT TO TAKE THE PHONE OFF THE HOOK,
AND YOU FORGET TO GET RID OF THE MORNING'S PAPER,
WHICH RODNEY HAD PURCHASED BEFORE BREAKFAST.

YOU RIPPED T ›dHE FATEFUL LOTTERY TICKET FROM THE DEAD MAN'S HAND
SO CARELESSLY YOU LEFT A FRAGMENT OF IT BEHIND.  THEN YOU 
BOLTED THE DOOR AND DEPARTED BY THE WINDOW AND THE FIRE-ESCAPE.
THAT WAS CLEVER, EXCEPT THAT YOU COULDN'T LATCH THE WINDOW
BEHIND            dYOU AND YOU LEFT YOUR FOOTPRINTS IN THE SNOW.
@YOU HAD CHILLED THE FLAT, BUT NOT ENOUGH.  BY THE TIME WE GOT
THERE THE SPILLED COFFEE WAS NOT YET FROZEN, RODNEY'S WOUND HAD
NOT COAGULATED, AND THE STOVE WAS STILL SLIGHTLY WARM, NONE OF
WHIC           "dH WOULD HAVE BEEN TRUE IF HE HAD REALLY DIED THE NIGHT
BEFORE.

ALL THIS, PLUS YOUR NEEDING MONEY FOR YOUR FAILING BUSINESS,
SHOULD CONVINCE ANY JURY IN THE REALM OF YOUR GUILT.

MR BLACKWELL: YOU'LL PAY FOR THIS, LORD COLIN.  YOU AND YOUR
           cdFRIEND FROM #4.
@LORD COLIN: DON'T THREATEN, BLACKWELL.  NOT POLITE.
AND #2, CONGRATULATIONS.  IT'S BEEN
A PLEASURE WORKING WITH YOU.

#1 #2: THE PLEASURE WAS ALL MINE, LORD COLIN.

YOU SHAKE HANDS WITH LORD COLIN, AND THAT IS

THE BLOODY THUMBPRINT ON THE SUICIDE NOTE IS TOO SMUDGED 
TO YIELD ANY FURTHER EVIDENCE.[

SUBSTANCE UNDER BLACKWELL'S THUMBNAIL IS SUGGESTIVE, TRUE,
BUT RATHER CIRCUMSTANTIAL, I'M AFRAID.  IT COULD WELL BE PAINT
OR SOME OTHER MUNDANE SUBSTANCE, AND WE DON'T HAVE A PROPER
LABORATORY HERE.            éARE YOU PAYING ATTENTION TO THE
QUESTION, #2?  WHAT WE WANT HERE IS SOMEONE'S NAME.

LORD COLIN: BLACKWELL IS WEARING A VARIETY OF CLOTHES, BUT
THERE'S NOTHING REMARKABLE ABOUT THEM AT FIRST GLANCE.
IF YOU WANT TO LOOK AT SOMETHING SPECIFIC PERHAPS YOU SHOULD
SAY SO.

#1 #2: QUITE RIGHT, LORD COLIN.                                   Ü
LORD COLIN: YOU WANT A HINT?  TOO RUDDY BAD, #2.
WELL, I SUPPOSE YOU COULD TRY LOOKING AT THE WHOLE
FLAT AGAIN, AND THEN LOOK AT EVERYTHING IT TELLS YOU
ABOUT.  AND THINK, FOR GOD'S SAKE.  THINK HARD.

#1 #2: THANK YOU, MY LORD.                      dA HINT?  NOT BLOODY LIKELY, #2.
WELL, PERHAPS A SMALL SUGGESTION.  TELL US YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT
EVIDENCE THERE IS.  THEN ASK TO LOOK AT THE WHOLE FLAT AGAIN, 
AND THEN LOOK AT THE THINGS YOU FIND THERE, LIKE THE BODY,
THE BED, THE TABLE, AND           ¨ì SO ON.  I'M SURE YOU CAN FIGURE OUT
WHAT HAPPENED.  WHEN YOU DON'T NEED TO SEE ANY MORE JUST
STATE YOUR EVIDENCE IN CLEAR SENTENCES: "THE PHONE WAS HUNG
UP ON THE HOOK," FOR EXAMPLE.  OH, AND READ THE QUESTION
