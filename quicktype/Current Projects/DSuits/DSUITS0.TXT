the same isosteps as m the original
transform to 1?
All this is to whet your appetite.
There's a lot to investigate here. For
example, do prime numbers play any
peculiar role in the transform to 1 (or
4 or 2)? Are there numbers whose step
count is prime? Are there prime isosteps? Is there a relationship between
any two numbers which have the same step
count (e.g., 5 and 32)? Is there a relationship between any two isosteps? Is
there any way to predict what a number's
step count will be, or whether it will be
an isostep? And.... Well, you get the
idea.
Happy transforms.
