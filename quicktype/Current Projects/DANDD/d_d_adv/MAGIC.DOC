        There are two classes of spells: Those that last for a while,
and those that don't.  In each of these classes are two further
distinctions: Spells that are meant for use in combat, and those that
aren't.

        Combat spells are flagged with a '*'.  These may or may not work,
depending on the relative levels of the spell caster and his target.  If
the opponent is a great deal more powerful than the Magic-User, it is
very highly resistant to the latter's magicking.  The formula for spell
efficacy varies from spell to spell, and contains a random factor.

        Some spells become more effective as the Magic-User increases in
power.  Spells such as Lightning Bolt use the caster's level as a base
number of points delivered, and then add on a random factor.  If this is
the case, the spell description mentions the exact formula.

        Each spell is described briefly, and is labeled with a '*', if
applicable.  In addition, each is labeled either 'Immediate' or
'Duration.'  The former do whatever it is that they do RIGHT NOW, while
the latter's effects take a little while to disperse.

        The next page contains the Spell Tables.  The four pages
following describe the spells themselves, one level per page.

                        Level 1 Spells:

*Magic Missile:         Fires a magical dart from the caster's finger.  This
        (Immediate)     does not miss, and does (level)+ 1-10 points of damage.

*Charm Monster:         Basically, this hypnotises the caster's opponent,
        (Immediate)     which therefore neither attacks nor dodges.  This
                        spell is easily broken, however.

Shield:                 Creates an invisible wall around the caster, causing
        (Duration)      any monster attacking to do so at a disadvantage.

*Sleep:                 Puts the caster's opponent into a deep sleep.  While
        (Immediate)     sleeping, it neither attacks nor dodges (obviously).

Protection from Evil:   Causes the caster's opponent to attack at a disad-
        (Duration)      vantage.

Light:                  Creates a point-source light, equivalent to one torch,
        (Duration)      over the caster's head.  Effects are cumulative.

                        Level 2 Spells:

*Phantasmal Force:      Causes the caster's opponent to believe it is confront-
        (Immediate)     ing a creature much mightier than itself.  This often
                        causes flight.

*Web:                   Entangles the caster's opponent in a magical net,
        (Immediate)     making it helpless to attack or defend itself.

*Lightning Bolt:        Delivers (level) + 2-16 points of electrical damage to
        (Immediate)     the caster's opponent.

Strength:               Temporarily augments the caster's Strength attribute,
        (Duration)      improving his/her combat skill commensurately.

Levitate:               Causes the caster to float (level) feet off the floor,
        (Duration)      making him/her harder to hit.

Invisibility:           Strangely enough, causes the caster to fade from sight.
        (Duration)      This puts monsters at a decided disadvantage.

                        Level 3 Spells:

*Fireball:              Causes a fiery explosion in the vicinity of the
        (Immediate)     caster's opponent.  Does (level) + 4-24 points of fire
                        damage.

*Confusion:             Causes the caster's opponent to lose clarity of mind,
        (Immediate)     with attendant co-ordination.  It cannot attack.  Spell
                        lasts for (level) + 1-6 rounds.

Pass Wall:              Shifts the molecular structure of the desired wall such
        (Immediate)     that it becomes as air, allowing passage through it.

*Hold Monster:          Mesmerises the caster's opponent so that it cannot
        (Immediate)     attack or dodge.

Fear:                   Causes the caster's opponent to become fearful of
        (Duration)      him/her, and attack at a disadvantage.

Continual Light:        Same as a Light spell (qv), save that this is twice as
        (Duration)      bright and lasts for the duration of the adventure.

Teleport:               Transports, instantly, the caster from where he is to
        (Immediate)     somewhere else.  The caster has no control of the dest-
                        ination.

*Power Word KILL:       Your basic Death Spell.  Causes the caster's opponent to
        (Immediate)     drop dead on the spot.

*Prismatic Wall:        Encases the caster in a multicoloured sphere with re-
        (Immediate)     markable powers of monster-damaging.  Does 5-40 points
                        of damage to the caster's antagonist.

Time Stop:              Freezes Time in the caster's vicinity, while permitting
        (Duration)      him/her to move freely.  Monsters cannot fight back.

*Pillar of Fire:        Causes the caster's target to be immolated in a pillar
        (Immediate)     of flames, causing (level)+ 3-18 points of fire damage.

*Summon Demon:          Calls one of Hell's denizens to the caster's aid.  The
        (Immediate)     demon will attempt to drag the caster's antagonist back
                        to Hell with it.
