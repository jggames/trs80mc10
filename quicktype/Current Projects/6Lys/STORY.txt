A long time ago, the Land of
Six Lilies lived happily.
One disastrous day, an
unknown hand broke
the stem of one of
the kingdom's protective
lilies and the five others,
in great anger, plunged
Princess Alicea into a
deep sleep with magic
potion. He made it known
that as long as they were
not not six, she would
remain like this. You,
Gael, the brave, will
you manage to steal
the lily that the
Dragon guards? Beware
of the trials and
multiple dangers of
his lair.
