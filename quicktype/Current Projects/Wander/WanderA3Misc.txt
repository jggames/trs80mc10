"                        Just Imagine ...

You are traveling as  First Under-secretary to the Ambassador for
the   Corps   Diplomatique  Terrestrienne,  (CDT).   Your  direct
superior, Mr. Magnan, has managed to duck out of the  action  and
leave   you   as  sole  assistant  to  his  superior,  Ambassador
Pouncetrifle.  (The Ambassador is a classic bungler and would, if
left on his own, mess things up badly.)

You have been sent to Aldebaran III where you  are  to  avert  an
uprising against Terran nationals expected at the end of April.

During your trip you  were  able  to  peruse  the  ship's  meager
library  and  make  a  few  notes  on the history, life-forms and
society of Aldebaran III, but much of Aldebaran culture is  still
a mystery.

It is the middle of the night; the ship  on which you arrived has
just departed from the small spaceport which you find to be windy
and deserted."

As you watch, amazed, the yangst turns a muddy, opaque brown and
starts to spin, rolling toward the zwerf which, in turn,
melts into a green, viscous fluid and starts seeping into the ground!

The yangst is now spinning madly and rolls over traces of the zwerf
which seem to boil away on contact!

After the last trace of the zwerf has been vaporized the spinning
yangst slows to a stop and resumes its alabaster translucency.

Before your startled eyes the pale xyller turns a deep crimson and,
emitting a piercing wail, slides toward the yangst!

The yangst frantically tries to roll away but is overtaken, engulfed
and consumed by the flushed xyller!

The xyller burps once and returns to its previous pale color, its wail
dying down to silence.

You realize that you've been holding your breath the whole time.

I will carry out any actions that you ask me to (assuming I understand what
you ask).  In general, you should type commands of one to five words; like
`quit', `take card', or `push red button'.  To move around type the direction
you want to go; e.g. `north', `up', etc.  The following commands are handy:
take, inventory, drop, look, read.\n"

  Aldebaran III is an eighty-four percent earth normal planet which
  revolves around a brilliant red star, (Aldebaran, or Alpha Tauri).
  A III has an atmosphere consisting of 52%% nitrogen, 26%% helium,
  20%% oxygen and 2%% other gases, (by volume).  The period of revo-
  lution of A III is 18.628 Earth Standard hours which is expressed
  in local time as 24 hours.  The axis of A III tilts less than a
  degree with respect to the ecliptic, (47.6'), providing virtually
  no variation in season and length of daylight, (sunrise is at 6:00
  Aldebaran Standard Time, sunset at 7:00 p.m. A.S.T.).

  The ruling species on Aldebaran III is a large, six \"legged\", (actually
  \"pseudopoded\"), mammal with a roughly Humanoid torso and a perfectly
  spherical \"brain-case\" containing, in most cases, a brain the size of
  a filbert.  (In a few, exceptional cases the brain is believed to be quite
  large.  This increased \"brain-power\" has no effect on intelligence but
  is believed to provide the ability to alter body appearance at will.)

  The natives of Aldebaran compensate for lack of intellect with sensitive
  organs for sight and smell located on five stalk-like extremities which
  radiate from the \"brain-case\".

  Aldebaranites are deeply religious.  They display fierce devotion to
  causes which they espouse without apparent rhyme or reason and which
  they may suddenly disavow for no apparent reason.  Much importance is
  said to be attached to symbolic acts and objects.

  Until the first Aldebaran-Terran trade treaty was negotiated in 2078
  by Adm. Kurasawa Perry the concepts of private property and monetary
  currency were unknown.  Since that time every sentient race in the
  galaxy has established trade with A III but, in compliance with the
  Galactic Accords of 2018,  no military bases have been built on A III.
  The currency in use is the Galactic Credit but \"magic\" artifacts are
  still highly valued although very little is known about these artifacts.

  Government is a representative democracy with all laws being made by the
  elected governmental representative, (called \"the Rep\"), whose term of
  office is 3 years unless that would cause and election to be held in a
  year divisible by fourteen in which case the term of office is 6 years.

  Aldebaran law, being the manifestation of the Rep, is held in great
  reverence by the populace and the punishments for infractions are
  extremely severe.  Because each new Rep must, during his first five
  months in office, repeal all laws enacted by the previous Rep and may
  not recreate any laws that a prior Rep had created no attempt will be
  made here to provide do's and dont's for A III.

  The official diplomatic language on Aldebarran is Glottus but very few,
  (if any), natives are believed to speak it.  Instead, approximately
  213 varieties of local dialect are used.  The dialectic differences
  between neighboring regions are small enough that most natives can under-
  stand the dialects of all neighboring regions but rarely the dialects
  of further regions.  The single, underlying factor in understanding
