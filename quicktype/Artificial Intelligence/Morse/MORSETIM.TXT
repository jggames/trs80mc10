This sub-routine installs an interrupt service routine and a USR() function to provide a 60 Hz counter.  The counter increments until it reaches 65535 then rolls over to 0.

Set X to the address where you want the code to be installed before GOSUBing to 3000.

Call USR(0) to reset the counter to 0.
Call USR(1) to get the current counter value.

Because this is interrupt driven, the counter will run until action is taken to disable it.

To stop the counter you can enter POKE 8,0.
To have it resume enter POKE 8,8.

You must stop the counter before using a SOUND statement otherwise the sound will play forever.  It should also be stopped before any CLOAD or CSAVE operations.
