                                    INTERNATIONAL DRAUGHTS

When entering moves type the row letter first followed by the column number.  After entering the
starting space and all the landing spaces, press ENTER to make your move.


International Draughts is played by two players, on opposite sides of a playing board, alternating
moves.  One player has light blue pieces, and the other has orange pieces. It is against the rules
for one player to move the other player's pieces.  The player with the light blue pieces makes the
first move unless stated otherwise. A move consists of a player moving their piece diagonally to
an adjacent unoccupied square.  If the square is occupied by an opponents' piece, it may be 
captured (and removed from the game) by jumping over it to the unoccupied square one square
beyond the opponent's piece. The playable surface consists of using only the dark squares of a 
board with alternating light and dark squares. A piece may move only diagonally into an 
unoccupied square. Capturing is mandatory.  The player who has no pieces remaining or cannot
move owing to being blocked loses the game.  Uncrowned pieces move one step diagonally, 
and may capture opponents' pieces by moving two consecutive steps in the same direction, jumping
over the opponent's piece on the first step.  Multiple opposing pieces may be captured in a single
turn provided this is done by successive jumps made by a single piece; these jumps do not need to
be in the same direction but may zigzag changing diagonal direction.  In international draughts pieces
may also capture (diagonally) backwards. When a piece reaches the crownhead or kings row
the farthest row forward), it becomes a king, and is marked by becoming blue for the light blue
pieces or red for the orange pieces and acquire additional powers including the ability to move
backwards and capture backwards.  As with non-king men, a king may make successive jumps
in a single turn provided that each jump captures an opponent man or king.  In international draughts,
the flying kings rule allows kings to move as far as they want along unblocked diagonals. This
move can (but need not) end by a capture in the usual way, jumping over an opposing piece to an
adjacent unoccupied square. Since captured pieces remain on the board until the turn is complete,
with flying kings it is possible for a king to reach a position where he is blocked from moving
further by a piece he has just captured.  When entering multiple manditory capture moves, enter
the starting space first and then all the landing spaces, before hitting ENTER.  Don't forget, that
in cases of flying kings, landing spaces need not be immediately next to a jumped piece.
