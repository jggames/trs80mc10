  To start off in Golden Voyage you arrive in a small kingdom where
the king is dying of old age.  He asks you to find the magical potion to
restore his long lost youth. You agree and begin your journey into the
high seas.  You only have 3 days to complete your mission, but first some
general hints to help get you started:

  1. The sandals will keep your feet from being stung.
  2. The only pieces of land are: Persian City, Small Island, Sandy Beach,
     and Rocky Strand.
  3. There are three fountains, only one holds the elixer..
  4. The white globe will blind the Cyclops.
