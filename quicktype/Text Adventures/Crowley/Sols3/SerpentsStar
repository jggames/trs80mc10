DIRECTIONS FOR MOVEMENT ARE GIVEN IN SQUARE BRACKETS.  FOR EXAMPLE, "SIT BY
EXPLORER" AND [NE,F,R,B,W] FOR NORTHEAST, FORWARD, RIGHT, BACK AND WEST.

"ASK HELP", "BUY DRINK", "OFFER DRINK", "ASK HELP" (YOU NOW HAVE THE LAMP AND
FUEL).  CONTINUE WITH "LEAVE", "REST", "OUT", "MOUNT".

NOW, IT'S OFF TO THE FIRST MONESTARY.  YOU SHOULD SAVE THE GAME (TYPE "SAVE
GAME") BEFORE MOVING ANY FURTHER, BECAUSE THE WOLF IS COMING UP AND YOU
PROBABLY WON'T MAKE IT PAST HIM THE FIRST TIME YOU TRY!
GO [SE] AND <SURPRISE!> THERE'S THE WOLF!.  KILLING THE WOLF IS A MATTER OF
TIMING.  WHAT YOU NEED TO DO IS TYPE "SHOOT" AS FAST AS YOU CAN FOR AS MANY
TIMES AS IT TAKES TO KILL HIM.  IT VARIES FROM 3 TO 6 TIMES.  ONCE THE WOLF IS
DEAD, GO [S] TO THE BRIDGE.

TYPE "DISMOUNT", "CROSS" AND THEN HEAD [NE].  THE MONK HAS SOMETHING YOU NEED,
SO TYPE "GREET MONK", "OFFER TSAMPA", "ASK ABOUT SCROLL", "GET MONK'S SCROLL".

FABLED MONESTARY WHERE THE STAR IS KEPT.

FROM THE MONESTARY, GO [S,NE,NE] TO THE CAVE ENTRANCE.  NOW, YOU SHOULD SAVE
THE GAME AGAIN BECAUSE ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE CAVE IS THE INFAMOUS ROCK/SNOW
SLIDE AND YOU'RE GONNA NEED A BUNCH OF TRIES BEFORE YOU GET THROUGH IT!!

TYPE "PUT FUEL IN LAMP", "LIGHT MATCH THEN LIGHT LAMP", THEN PROCEED [F,F].
THERE IS A CRYSTAL STATUETTE TO BE FOUND IN THE CAVE, BUT LEAVE IT ALONE!  GO
[F] ONE MORE TIME AND YOU WILL BE AT THE SNOW/ROCK SLIDE WHICH IS THE MOST
DIFFICULT PART OF THE GAME TO GET THROUGH.  IT'S ANOTHER ONE OF THOSE TRIAL-
AND-ERROR THINGS WHERE YOU JUST HAVE TO KEEP GOING UNTIL YOU GET THRU IT.  WHEN
YOU LOOK AT THE SCREEN, YOU WILL SEE ONE BOULDER THAT BOUNCES OFF THE MOUNTAIN
AND IS HIGHLIGHTED AGAINST THE SKY AS IT GOES DOWN THE TOWARD THE ROAD.  IF YOU
FOLLOW THIS BOULDER DOWN, YOU WILL SEE THAT AT ONE POINT IT HITS THE GROUND
JUST TO THE LEFT OF THE ROAD.  AS SOON AS IT BOUNCES UP AGAIN, PRESS A KEY!

GO [F] AND A WHOLE SERIES OF SCREENS GO BY EXPLAINING ABOUT IT BEING NIGHT
TIME AND THE AIR AROUND THE RUINS IS MYSTERIOUS, ETC.  ONCE THE FABLED
MONESTARY APPEARS, TYPE "KNOCK", "OFFER MONK'S SCROLL", "DISMOUNT", "DROP
REINS", "IN".

NOW THAT YOU'RE INSIDE, GO [F,F,F] ALL THE WAY UP TO THE STATUE OF BUDDHA,

DOOR", GO [L] AND "LOOK STAFF".  YOU SEE THE INSCRIPTION YOU WILL NEED TO KILL
THE DEMON GUARDS LATER ON.  TYPE "GET SCROLL", AND THEN GO [B] AND "OUT" BACK
TO THE COURTYARD.

TIMES TO GET ALL THE FLAMES OUT.  THEN "OPEN DOOR" AND GO [F] WHERE YOU FIND 3
OF THE 6 GEMS YOU WILL NEED.  TYPE "OPEN CHEST", "GET ALL" AND GO [F] AND "OPEN
BOX".  THE BLACK CLOUD WILL CAUSE YOU TO STUMBLE AROUND IN THE DARK, SO TO
MAKE THINGS EASY, JUST TYPE [N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N] AND YOU'LL BE IN THE LITTLE
ARMORY.

TYPE "PUT STAFF IN PACK", "GET SHIELD" AND GO [D].  TYPE "DROP SHIELD", "GET
STAFF", "SAY TSKDG", "PUT STAFF IN PACK", "LOOK FLOOR", "GET ALL" (INCLUDING
GEM #4), AND "OPEN DOOR".

GO [F], "GET ALL" (GEM #5), THEN [F,F] TO THE OLD SAGE.  HE WILL ASK YOU THREE
QUESTIONS; YOUR THREE ANSWERS ARE "DRAGON", "YIN AND YANG", AND "MAN",
RESPECTIVELY.  NOW GO [R]

YOU ARE NOW AT THE MAZE.  IT SEEMS THE AUTHORS LEFT A BIT OF DEBUGGING CODE IN,
SO IF YOU TYPE "STAT" WHILE IN THE MAZE, IT WILL TELL YOU WHERE YOU ARE AND
WHAT DIRECTION YOU'RE FACING!  BUT TO SAVE YOU THE TROUBLE OF WENDING YOUR WAY
AROUND, HERE IS THE SEQUENCE TO REACH THE DOOR OF THE DRAGON'S LAIR:

THE FOLLOWING PATH IS THE SHORTEST WAY TO GET THRU THE MAZE.  FIRST, GO [L,L],
"GET ALL" (THE LAST OF THE 6 GEMS), THEN GO [B,F,L,F], "RING GONG", [B,F,L,L],
"DROP MATCHES", "GET TSAMPA", [R,F,L,L] AND YOU'RE AT THE DOOR...NOW YOU KNOW
WHAT THE SIX GEMS ARE FOR!  THEY HAVE TO BE INSERTED INTO THE DOOR IN THE
PROPER ORDER, SO TYPE:

" PUT BLACK GEM      IN DOOR"
" PUT VIOLET CRYSTAL IN DOOR"
" PUT BLUE STONE     IN DOOR"
" PUT GREEN GEM      IN DOOR"
" PUT ORANGE GEM     IN DOOR"
" PUT CLEAR CRYSTAL  IN DOOR"

THE DOOR WILL OPEN, SO GO [F].

TYPE "BLOW SHELL".  THE DRAGON WILL APPEAR AND ASK TWO QUESTIONS.  YOU ONLY HAV
E TO ANSWER ONE, AS THE SHIELD WILL PROTECT YOU IF YOU MISS ONE OF THEM...
TO SAVE WEAR AND TEAR ON THE SHIELD, HOWEVER, YOUR TWO ANSWERS (IN ORDER) ARE:
"RAINBOW" AND "NIRVANA".

THE DRAGON WILL NOW DISAPPEAR AND YOU CAN THEN "DROP ALL", "GET SERPENT'S
STAR", "LOOK NICHE", "PUT SERPENT'S STAR IN NICHE" AND YOU'RE DONE!!
