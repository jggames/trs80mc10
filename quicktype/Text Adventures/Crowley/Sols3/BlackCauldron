 Ok, I'll first give the hints out for those who don't wanna know how to
win in the game. 
 
Ok, let's start at the begining...
 
You are Taran, assistant pig-keeper, caring the mysterious pig, Hen Wen.
Now, you take the gruel outta the fire in the cottage of Dalben and feed
it to him. Now, if you couldn't find that out...my friend, you have a
SERIOUS problem. Ok, Hen Wen does his thing and a vision appears. Now!
You must hide him or the evil horned king will grab him to locate the
Black Cauldron. But where do you hide him? In the secret cottage of
course. Now if you bought the game, you know exactly where it is,
if not I'll tell ya. (If you don't wanna know, why the heck are you
reading this file in the first place?)
 
The Secret Cottage
------------------
 
The Secret Cottage is located on a screen right next to a river. You can't
miss it. The screen is almost totally infested with brush and shrub. It's
kinda hard to get through these bushes, but you can. Now There is a BIG
bush in the back (near the right) See it? Now go to it! (Duh) Allright
your right in front of it...Now go up...won't go eh? Well then..go a bit
more to the right and try again....you know if you suceeded when you see
a little cottage with smoke comin' out from the chimney. Open the door and
you'll find a nice little dude (from the fairy folk) who will take Hen
Wen from ya and keep him safe. The little guy will also give you a magic
word, and if you say it in the right area, you'll have access to the
fairy folk town. Now your next mission is....
 
Because this is a major part of the game the hint part has ended...
 
Press <ESC> now if you don't want to know how to win. What? The dumb
sysop supressed it? Ok, Close you eyes and I'll beep 5 times at the end
of the file. What? He killed that key too? Call another AE!
 
Solves
------
 
Ok let me first list all the useless items...
 
The Harp  The Corn  The Magic Mirror  The Keys 
 
Useless, meaning that you don't need 'em to win the game. You can get 'em
if you want....perhaps some of them give you points...
 
Ok, Before you start on your quest, FILL YOU WATER FLASK! It's so darn
annoying when you dehydrate when the black cauldron explodes! Ok, got
everything....let's go...
 
Mad Taran: Beyond Cottage
-------------------------
(Don't ask)
 
Ok now, get the lute hidden in a hole of a tree. It's about 2 screens down
from the secret cottage area...BE SURE TO "DO" TWICE. Only once would make
you look at the lute. Got it? Allright. Go to the waterfall...now see
the nice round rock blocking you from the waterfall. Now say the magic
word the little dude gave ya...remember? The rock will move and you'll
be on your way! You found the village of the fair folk..(What Phun!)
Now this little fairy foolk king will come up to you and act like
a total jerk (Wish I could squash him)...Give him the lute and he'll
be very happy. So happy that he'll give you 2 items, flying dust
and the magic mirror....the dust let's ya' fly (Just like those
fairies) and the mirror will show what a person's personality is.
Now...you're all set to destroy the cauldron! 
 
Setting out on the Dusty Road
-----------------------------
(These titles are SO creative)
 
Well, you go to the evil realm of the horned king which is directly right
from the peaceful forest...

I just luv text graphics(Don't you?) Ok Now leave the forest go 
left...into the evil forest! You can't do a thing there so go north.
If you come across a river....do not cross it or you'll be one 
dead Taran! Instead, go back to the forest and cross it there.
Now, go up those dumb rocks..it's kinda hard because of the 3-d
scenario but you can do it.....when you're at the base go directly
right and find your way up.... the other ways are dead ends(Ho hum)
Now Use the rope to tie to that dead branch...Got it? Now Do , to
climb ...point your joystick or keyboard so your in a diagonal
direction...don't stop or go another way or you'll be one nice
decoration on those rocks you passed. Now that you made that...
You'll be on a wall scene....it's easy to pass..just cling on
the wall and be sure not to touch the top or bye bye baby.
Now that you've done that! Go on young quester!
 
The Castle
----------
 
You are introducecd to it by a good scene ( Not good as the IBM version,
but good) of the castle. I guess this screen is only for sight seeing so
g north! Oh boy! The 1st screen explains itself. Now you see the alligator
infested moat? Dive in! That's right! Dive! "Mmmm...", says Mr. Alligator.
Now avoid them....I'm just sure that your having a great time...eh amigo?
Get onto the ledge on the other side! Now wasn't that fun? Now climb the
wall! Avoid the nice falling boulders and large blocks of the wall and
your safe. For a while. When you reach the top, Go to that little yellow
square at the top of the next screen. USE your dagger to cut through
the vines, and you're in! The castle is constantly being guarded by
guards( What else?) Let one of 'em capture you! You're taken to a cell
and grab the tin can. Now, USE the can right next to the door. This
girl will come and she is basically useless. Now you're in the catacombs
of the castle...here's a map

As I said before, I luv t-graphics. Twist the gargoyle to go up. Now 
the sword can knock out those blasted guards(Yay!) Let me make a map of the
castle...woopee another map!

Now grab all your stuff in the closet and get outa there! Your almost done!
The Dungeon is very simple and it doesn't need to be mapped. This t-file
is SO Long!
 
The Witches
-----------
 
The witches are located in the marsh. See the little strip of land? Go to
it and you should see a house....Whoops! Go to it with flying powder!
Now go in and open the chest...frogs will come out and after a while the
witches will appear to turn you into one. Quickly give 'em you sword
and they will give the black cauldron. What phun! Now you can't use it.
Lovely isn't it? One of the king's flying whatevers will swoop down and
snag it away from you....go back to the castle..and go to the king's lab.
He's in there raising the dead. Don't let 3 warriors arise or his army
will be complete...Now you have 2 choices...Jump into the cauldron
and stop the spel or let gurgi do it( You had to feed the little
rascal and apple or cookie before) He jumps in and the castle
explodes...(Don't do anything here).... You grap a log (Automatic of course)
and you go down the river...and poof you're in the forest. The witches then
make a deal for the black cauldron...
 
                      1. A book of Knowledge
                      2. A pot of gold
                      3. Gurgi alive again
 
Now you obviously pick the 3rd one....try 1 or 2 for phun and see what happens.
 
There you have it! you won the game... yay! 
 
Ok, for those who had their eyes closed, open 'em!
