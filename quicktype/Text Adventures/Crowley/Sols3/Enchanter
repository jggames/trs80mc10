YOU ARE NOW IN THE CASTLE. WHEN THE PROGRAM SAYS THAT YOUR
THROAT IS DRY, THEN DRINK WATER. WHEN IT SAYS THAT YOUR STOMACH
IS GRUMBLING, EAT BREAD.

WHEN YOU SLEEP, YOU WILL HAVE A DREAM ABOUT THE BED YOU ARE
SLEEP- ING ON. ALL DREAMS ARE HINTS! ALSO, FROM NOW ON, ANYTIME
THE PROGRAM TELLS YOU THAT YOU ARE TIRED, THEN SLEEP.(YES, RIGHT
ON THE FLOOR!) THE REASON YOU HAVE TO SLEEP ON THE BED IS SO YOU
CAN HAVE THIS CERTAIN DREAM. NOW, ON WITH THE ADVENTURE.

YOU WILL NOW BE IN ONE OF FOUR MIRROR ROOMS. WAIT IN ANY ONE
UNTIL YOU SEE AN ADVENTURER FROM ZORK I ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE
MIRROR. WHEN YOU SEE HIM:

"ZIFMIA ADVENTURER-VAXUM ADVENTURER- SHOW DAGGER TO ADVENTURER-"
 (GO EAST UNTIL YOU GET TO A ROOM WITH MONSTERS GUARDING A DOOR)
 "POINT AT DOOR-N-DROP ALL BUT BREAD,JUG AND LANTERN-GET MAP AND
 PENCIL-S-CLOSE DOOR-W-W-W-W-W-W-S-S-W-W-W-NW-NE-FILL

THIS IS THE SECOND TO LAST PART OF THE ADVENTURE. AT THIS POINT
YOU ARE IN A VERY WEIRD KIND OF ROOM! REMEMBER THE MAP YOU
PICKED UP? READ IT NOW. THE MAP IS THE MAP TO THE TRANSLUCENT
CORRIDORS. IF YOU CONNECT TWO OF THE LETTERS (IE.'CONNECT B
AND J") THEN YOU WILL ACTUALLY MAKE A CORRIDOR! NOW, WHAT YOU
ARE GOING TO DO IS RELEASE ULTIMATE EVIL FROM ITS LAIR AND ERASE
CERTAIN SO YOU TRAP HIM IN ANOTHER PART OF THE TRANSLUCENT
CORRIDORS. YOU WANT TO DO THIS BECAUSE THE SCROLL THAT YOU NEED
TO KILL KRILL WITH IS IN HIS LAIR! OK THIS IS HOW YOU DO IT:

"S-E-NE-SE-CONNECT F AND P-SW-SW-GET SCROLL-ERASE B AND R-ERASE

 SCROLL-U-U-E-E-N-N-N-N-N-E- OPEN DOOR-N-DROP MAP AND PENCIL-GET
 ALL BUT MAP AND PENCIL-S-W-S-S-E-E"

NOW TRY GOING UP THE STAIRS. YOU CAN CLIMB THEM BUT YOU CAN'T
REACH THE TOP! THIS STAIRWAY IS THE LAST PUZZLE YOU NEED TO
SOLVE BEFORE YOU KILL KRILL.

                          THAT'S IT!!!
