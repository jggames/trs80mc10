WELCOME TO THE STEP-BY-STEP SOLUTION TO

             CRITICAL MASS

        AS TOLD BY THE MANIAC.


NOTES: THE COMMANDS THAT YOU TYPE ARE
       INSIDE THE "" MARKS.
       THE REST ARE COMMENTS TO HELP
       YOU FOLLOW ALONG.

AT TIMES IT MAY SEEM THAT YOU COULD
SKIP MANY OF THE SEQUENCES AND SAVE
YOURSELF LOTS OF TIME.  UNFORTUNATELY,
AS IN ESCAPE FROM RUNGISTAN, FUTURE
EVENTS DEPEND A GREAT DEAL UPON WHAT
YOU DO IN THE BEGINNING.  EVEN WITH
THIS FEATURE CRITICAL MASS CAN BE
PLAYED ALL THE WAY THROUGH IN UNDER
HALF AN HOUR (DEPENDING ON HOW GOOD YOU
ARE AT WATER SKIING).

ON WITH THE ADVENTURE!!!
