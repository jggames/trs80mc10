Ware released 8/8/85.  Solution released 8/11/85.  Solution Time:1 day.
(Sol.Time. is how long this adv takes an average player (me) to solve.)
 
Part I : Deductive Cheating
 
The following methods can be used to provide hints, if you don't want the
exact solution.  This alternate approach can sometimes prove to be just as
challenging as playing the game.  For those who do not want the exact
solution, but would rather try my alternate approach, I have included some
ways to get help...  First, run the program.  When you get to the first
room, everything has been loaded up, and you are ready to go.
Hit ctrl-reset.  Type this in for a list of the game's main responses:
]NEW
]10 FORX=1TO100:&?X,X,X:?:NEXTX
]RUN
Now for the pics, and objects... reboot the disk, hit reset once again
from the main prog.  Now catalog the disk.  Objects are titled with
"O(object#).SPC", Pics are titled with "R(pic#).spc".  a quick examination
of the program reveals a simple way to see any of the graphics that you
want.. This sometimes proves helpful, as you can find out where the game
leads, and where you should be looking for secret exits, etc:
FOR ROOMS:
]HGR
]BLOADR(room#).SPC,A5121
]GOSUB320
FOR OBJECTS:
]HGR
]BLOADO(object#).SPC,A5121
]GOSUB325
 
Looking through the program, you will find that the variable 'X' stands
for the interpretation of the object (2nd word) of your input, 'P' is the
room number, and 'V' is the verb >AND THE LINE NUMBER THE PROG GOES TO TO
PRINT THE RESULT OF THAT VERB WHEN COMBINED WITH OBJECT 'X'<.  Now we
examine the program.  You will notice that before every input, the
program goes to 7000.  It might be a good idea, therefore, before looking
through the program for help, to add a ?"X=";X;",P=";P;",V=";V before the
other commands at 7000.  This will let you know where you are, and what
the programs interpretation number is for what you type in.  Later,
when you look through the program, you will find lines like:
XXXX IF X=49 THEN ....etc...., and you will need to know how to get X to
equal that number, etc.  Right now I will quickly review the game structure.
 
XAPOV.SPC=MAIN TITLE ("GUIDE")
KOKO.SP=PART OF ABOVE
S0.SPC=PIC OF SAGE'S EYES
S1-5.SPC=SAGE'S WORDS
R0-40.SPC=ROOMS
O0-24.SPC=OBJECTS
MT=MAIN PROGRAM (BASIC)
DATA=SAME AS SAVED GAME,LOADS EVERY TIME UNLESS YOU RESTORE GAME
 
And now for the solution, give/take a few minor/major points of the
game(!)...
