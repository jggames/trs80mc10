SPECIAL THANKS TO THE MINES OF MORIA I

WARNING: THIS WALKTHRU SHOWS HOW TO
SOLVE "DEATH IN THE CARIBBEAN" STEP BY
STEP - THESE ARE NOT HINTS!

QUOTES, SO TYPE WHAT YOU SEE.
 THE OBJECT OF THIS ADVENTURE IS TO
FIND A TREASURE CHEST. START OUT WITH
"N","E","N","E","GET WAGON". THEN "W",
"S","E","GET ROCK","E","OPEN BOX",
"GET KEY", "N". YOU ARE NOW AT THE
ANTHILL WHICH YOU MUST PLUG UP. SO,
"PLUG HOLE", IT ASKS YOU WITH WHAT?
AND YOU ANSWER "ROCK". THEN "N", "GET
RING". THIS IS A MAGIC RING WHICH WILL
TRANSPORT YOU FROM ONE PLACE TO ANOTHER
IF YOU HAVE BEEN TO THAT PLACE BEFORE.
(YOU CAN'T GO ANYWHERE YOU HAVEN'T
BEEN).
 CONTINUE WITH "S","W","N","N","E".
THEN "DROP KEY". YOU ARE LEAVING THE
KEY HERE FOR FUTURE USE. THEN "W","W",
"GET SHOVEL". YOU ARE IN THE GRAVEYARD.
OCCASIONALLY THERE IS A GHOST THAT
APPEARS WHO WILL HIDE ANY OF THE ITEMS
YOU ARE CARRYING. IF HE DOES THIS,
THEN YOU WILL FIND THE ITEMS HERE, BUT
YOU MUST DIG THE GRAVE TO GET THEM.
 NOW GO "E","N","W","GET ROPE","S","W",

"S","GET LIFE-BELT", "WEAR LIFE-BELT",

RIVER, SO "DROP LIFE-BELT", "DROP
SHOVEL", "DROP RING", "DROP BOTTLE",
"N","E","E" "GET AMULET". THIS AMULET
WILL KEEP THE GHOST FROM STEALING YOUR

THEN GO "S","S", "GET RING", "GET
LANTERN", "GET MATCHES","LIGHT
MATCHES","LIGHT LANTERN","DROP
MATCHES","DROP AMULET". NOW YOU NEED

"GET KEY", "UNLOCK DOOR". IT WILL SAY
WITH WHAT? YOU SAY "KEY".
 YOU ARE INSIDE THE CHURCH, SO GO "S",
