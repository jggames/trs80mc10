       HOW TO SOLVE DARK CRYSTAL
  
=========*
   
NOW, AS BEFORE, EVERYTHING IN "QUOTES" IS A DIRECT COMMAND, AND EVERYTHING
INSIDE A [BRACKET] IS A DIRECTIONAL MOVE. (NORTH, SOUTH, EAST, WEST).

1st- GETTING STARTED

1. To escape the Garthim just enter a direction, you will always out run
   them as they are slow!

2. The 'crystal bat' alerts the skeksis of where you are, and in turn, the
   Garthim are informed of your location.

3. Mystics are your friends

4. You don't have to get the following items as they do you no good:
   sling & pouch

5. There is >>no<< score in the DARK CRYSTAL adventure. The object is to
   heal the DARK CRYSTAL

6. See the movie (optional), many of the hints are revealed after seeing it.

=========*
NOW TO SOLVE IT:
=========*

At the start of the game just try to move in >>any<< direction. a mystic
will appear.

After he leaves follow these directions: [E], "get shale", [W,W,W,W,N], 

Now you should be at Ursu so type "speak ursu" then "look bowl" 
then go [S,E,E,N], and "dig", "get flute" and take one step [N]orth. 
(you will fall down but don't worry about it.)

Now go: [E,N], "listen brook", then [W]est, "cut pad", [E,E,E,E,N,N] 
and "use pad" (at swamp)
After you get off the pad go [N,E]. you will get caught up in some vines.
Just start typing directions until the drive turns on and the picture
changes.... a long arm w/an eye will be thrust up toward you..... type
"speak being", next type "yes", and then "moon daughters" (answer to the
riddle). Now type a random direction as it won't matter because it breaks
into the move and gives you 'before Jen can react...' message.

She will take you to her observatory, and then ask you what you want. 
Type "CRYSTAL shard" and she will bring you 4 colored shards.... 
Now "play flute", and then "get blue"
(the blue CRYSTAL should play back the tune that you issue)

Now go [S]outh, !!Garthim raid!!, terribile Garthim storm Augra's lab.
So type "go window", then [S,W] and you will fall into a bog...
Type "help"; Kira & Fizzgig will help you out.

Now type "turn shell", "get pouch", "go shell" and you enter at the pod
village.... just try to move around until the Garthim arrive and then go:
[S]outh, (change disks), now go: [S,W,N], and "sit down", then "look
wall", (take notice of the shapes very carefully)

Now type [N]orth, but before it moves you north, a creature will appear and
say that he will help you! (( he lies!!! )) a trap!! DON'T FOLLOW
HIM! (He will go south) now type: [N,N,W,S,S,E,N], now, depending on
which version of d.c. you have, you should be at the land-striders (two
long-legged beasts) so type "jump on"and go [W,W,W,W,W,S,W,S] and you will
be knocked off your steeds. So as the Garthim approach, type "jump", then
while falling, "grab Kira". When you on the ground go [W]est, and
then "send Fizzgig" (it will ask where you want to send it) so then type
"send bars", do another random move to waste a move and Fizzgig will return
before you can react. Now type "use key", "open bars" and then go:
[S,S,S,W,W,S] and the chamberlain will appear and steal Kira & Fizzgig.

Now go [S]outh! (you will fall in a pit with Garthim!) so type "run", 
then "go hole", "climb", and you will be in the chamber of life. 
(Augra will be here all wrapped up, you can leave her as it will not affect
the game play)

Go: [E,S,E,W,W,], "go curtain", then [N,N,W], & "get scepter", 
[E,E,E] and "use hook"

Now go :[E,U,E] (U=up) and you will be on the balcony.

Now type "jump CRYSTAL", you will drop the shard.

Ok, now you will have a choice:
A- save Kira
B- heal CRYSTAL

To the question '..save Kira..' type "no" ---
( and no, I'm not heartless). 
Now type "insert shard"<<--------

You win..... or do you?

     ----> Kira is dead <----
  
Logical answer: "kiss Kira"
