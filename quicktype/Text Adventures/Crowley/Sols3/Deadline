=====================================

HERE IS THE SOLUTION FOR SOLVING
INFOCOM'S MYSTERY GAME, DEADLINE. ALL
COMMANDS WHICH SHOULD BE TYPED IN
EXACTLY AS YOU SEE THEM ARE IN QUOTES.
DIRECTIONAL MOVEMENTS ARE IN BRACKETS.
E.G. "OPEN DOOR" AND [N,N,E].

ROBIN HOOD DID AN EXCELLENT JOB OF
EXPLAINING THE SOLUTION, BUT BECAUSE
OF TYPOS OR PERHAPS BECAUSE OF
DIFFERENT VERSIONS OF DEADLINE, IT
DIDN'T WORK ON MY COPY.

=====================================
FROM THE FRONT PATH OF THE ROBNER'S
ESTATE, GO [N] TO THE FRONT DOOR OF
THE HOUSE.  TYPE "OPEN DOOR" AND GO
[N] INTO THE ROBNERS' HOUSE.  FROM
INSIDE THE DOOR, GO [N,E] AND TYPE
"CLIMB STAIRS" TWICE (OR YOU CAN JUST
GO [U,U]) TO GET TO THE SECOND LEVEL
OF THE ESTATE.  FROM THERE, GO
[W,W,W,W,N] TO THE LIBRARY WHERE YOU
WILL START THE FIRST OF A SERIES OF
SHERLOCK HOLMES-TYPE ACTIVITIES.

IN DEADLINE, YOU NEED TO ESTABLISH THE
MOTIVE AND METHOD FOR THE MURDER
BEYOND ALL REASONABLE DOUBT BEFORE YOU
CAN ARREST THE GUILTY PARTY.  IF YOU
DON'T HAVE AN AIR-TIGHT CASE, THE JURY
WILL ACQUIT THE DEFENDANT.  IT IS HERE
IN THE LIBRARY WHERE WE GO ABOUT
ESTABLISHING THE METHOD BY WHICH POOR
MR. ROBNER WAS DONE IN.

FIRST OFF, TYPE "EXAMINE RUG" (OR JUST
"LOOK RUG"). YOU WILL FIND SOME MUD
SPOTS WHICH IS YOUR FIRST CLUE.  NOW,
"GET THE CUP,PAD,CALENDAR AND PENCIL"
AND "RUB PENCIL ON PAD" AND THEN "TURN
PAGE OF CALENDAR".  AHA!  PERHAPS A
CLUE AS TO THE MOTIVE?  LET'S SEE IF
WE CAN SUBSTANTIATE THE METHOD A
LITTLE MORE...THAT MUD ON THE RUG WAS
VERY INTERESTING.  TYPE "OPEN BALCONY
DOOR" AND GO [N] ONTO THE BALCONY.
CHECK OUT THE RAILING BY TYPING
"EXAMINE RAILING" AND YOU WILL SEE
SOME SCRATCHES, LENDING CREDENCE TO
THE THEORY THAT PERHAPS THE MURDERER
CLIMBED UP THE BALCONY FROM THE GROUND
BELOW WHERE HE (OR SHE) GOT MUD ON HIS
SHOES.  LET'S HAVE A LOOK BELOW AND
CHECK FOR SOME INDICATION THAT THE
MURDERER WAS INDEED BELOW THE
BALCONY.

GO [S,S,E,E,E,E,D,D,W,S].  TYPE "OPEN
DOOR" AND GO [S] BACK TO THE FRONT
DOOR.  NOW GO [E,NE,E,SE] TO THE SHED
WHERE YOU WILL SEE A LADDER.  TYPE
"EXAMINE LADDER".  HMMM!  THIS
LADDER-AND-BALCONY THEORY IS LOOKING
GOOD!  LET'S SEE IF WE CAN PROVE THE
LADDER WAS BELOW THE BALCONY.  THIS
WILL HAVE TO WAIT A WHILE, THOUGH,
BECAUSE IT'S GETTING LATE IN THE
MORNING AND WE HAVE TO DO SOME MORE
CHECKING IN THE HOUSE BEFORE THE
READING OF THE WILL TAKES PLACE.  AND
BESIDES THAT, WE NEED TO TALK TO MR.
MCNABB AND HE DOESN'T SEEM TO BE IN
THE MOOD RIGHT NOW.

GO BACK TO THE HOUSE BY HEADING
[NW,W,S,W] AND HEAD BACK UPSTAIRS WITH
[N,N,E,U,U].  LET'S SEE WHAT ELSE WE
CAN FIND UPSTAIRS.  GO [S,S] INTO
DUNBAR'S BATHROOM.  TYPE "OPEN
CABINET" AND "EXAMINE LOBLO".  AHA,
AGAIN!  NOW WE GO BACK DOWNSTAIRS AND
SEE IF WE CAN FIND MR. MCNABB TO SEE
IF HE KNOWS ANYTHING ABOUT A LADDER
UNDER THE BALCONY.  GO
[N,N,D,D,W,S,S].  LET'S TAKE A BREAK
FOR A WHILE.  TYPE "WAIT UNTIL
11:30".

AND NOW FOR MR. MCNABB.  LET'S TRY THE
ORCHARD FIRST WITH [E,NE,E].  IF
MCNABB IS NOT AROUND, JUST WAIT FOR A
WHILE OR SNOOP AROUND THE AREA AND HE
WILL SOON SHOW UP.  DEADLINE IS VERY
UNPREDICTABLE WHEN IT COMES TO THE
VARIOUS CHARACTERS MOVING AROUND THE
SCENARIO.  ONCE YOU SPOT MCNABB, GO TO
HIM AND SAY "HEY MCNABB" FOLLOWED BY
"WHAT IS WRONG".  HE WILL TELL YOU
ABOUT SOME HOLES HE FOUND IN HIS
GARDEN SO, NATURALLY, YOU SAY "SHOW ME
THE HOLES".  HE WILL TAKE OFF AND YOU
"FOLLOW HIM".  WHEN HE STOPS, TYPE
 HIM".  WHEN HE STOPS, TYPE
"EXAMINE HOLES".  EUREKA!  THE LADDER
WAS HERE AND THE DEPTH OF THE HOLES
PROVES SOMEBODY CLIMBED IT UP TO THE
BALCONY!

TO MAKE SURE WE COVER EVERY ANGLE,
TYPE "EXAMINE GROUND" AND "DIG AROUND
HOLES".  HMMM...WONDER WHAT THIS COULD
BE ABOUT?  TO FIND OUT, TYPE "ANALYZE
FRAGMENT FOR LOBLO".  OOPS, IT'S LATER
THAN WE THOUGHT!  BACK TO THE HOUSE
FOR THE READING OF THE WILL.  GO
[N,N,SE,S,S,W] TO THE FRONT DOOR AND
[N,N,W] INTO THE LIVING ROOM.  NOW
JUST "WAIT" FOR THE WILL TO BE READ.
NOTICING THAT JUST ABOUT EVERYBODY IS
PRESENT, YOU DECIDE TO SEE IF YOU CAN
ROUST SOME OF THOSE PRESENT INTO
GIVING YOU SOME CLUES AS TO THE GUILTY
PARTY AND, PERHAPS, THE MOTIVE FOR THE
CRIME.

LET'S START WITH GEORGE.  TYPE "SHOW
GEORGE THE CALENDAR".  HE WILL GET
VERY NERVOUS AND START HEADING OUT OF
THE ROOM.  TYPE "FOLLOW HIM" UNTIL HE
FINALLY GOES TO HIS ROOM.  HE WILL
KEEP TELLING YOU TO LEAVE HIM ALONE,
BUT JUST KEEP FOLLOWING HIM UNTIL HE
GETS TO HIS ROOM.  AT THIS POINT, YOU
DECIDE TO SEE IF GEORGE KNOWS MORE
THEN HE'S TELLING.  YOU AREN'T GOING
TO GET ANYTHING FROM HIM HERE, SO
LET'S GO TO THE BALCONY AND WAIT TO
SEE IF HE DOES ANYTHING.  GO [N,W,N,N]
TO THE BALCONY AND TYPE "WAIT 10
MINUTES".  VOILA!  HERE HE COMES!
WAIT UNTIL HE GOES BEHIND THE
BOOKSHELF AND THEN TYPE "WAIT 4
MINUTES" TO GIVE HIM TIME TO REALLY
GET HIS HANDS INTO THE COOKIE JAR.

WHEN YOUR 4 MINUTES ARE UP, GO [S],
"EXAMINE BOOKSHELF", "PRESS BUTTON",
AND GO [E].  HA!  CAUGHT HIM
RED-HANDED!!  TYPE "GET WILL", "LOOK
SAFE", "GET PAPERS" AND "READ PAPERS".
THINGS ARE BEGINNING TO LOOK UP!
LET'S SEE IF WE CAN SUBSTANTIATE SOME
OF THIS STUFF.  GO BACK TO THE LIVING
ROOM WITH [W,S,E,E,E,E,D,D,W,W].  MY,
ISN'T THIS COZY!  TYPE "HEY BAXTER",
"WHAT ABOUT FOCUS".  YOU KNOW HE'S
LYING SO YOU "SHOW PAPERS TO BAXTER".
AH, THAT'S BETTER!  NOW FOR SOME
CLEVER PSYCHO-DETECTIVE WORK.  TYPE
"SHOW LAB REPORT TO DUNBAR" AND "SHOW
LAB REPORT TO BAXTER".  WHIP AROUND
AND "ACCUSE DUNBAR".  HMMM...A TAD
NERVOUS, ISN'T SHE?  PERHAPS WE SHOULD
GO OFF AND WAIT TO SEE WHAT DEVELOPS.

GO [E] TO LEAVE THE ROOM AND "WAIT FOR
DUNBAR".  JUST AS WE SUSPECTED!  WHEN
SHE PASSES YOU, TYPE "FOLLOW HER".
ONCE OUTSIDE THE HOUSE, SHE WILL DROP
A TICKET.  TYPE "GET TICKET" AND "READ
TICKET".  WOW!  THIS IS GETTING GOOD!
TYPE "SHOW TICKET TO DUNBAR".  YOU
KNOW YOU'VE GOT HER ON THE RUN NOW SO
HEAD OFF TO THE SHED TO WAIT AND SEE
WHAT DEVELOPS.  GO [E,E,SE] AND "WAIT
FOR BAXTER".  WHEN THEY BOTH SHOW UP,
"SHOW TICKET TO BAXTER" AND "ARREST
BAXTER AND DUNBAR".  YOU DIDN'T
BELIEVE THEM FOR A MINUTE, DID YOU?

DUE TO THE DYNAMIC NATURE OF DEADLINE,
THERE ARE SEVERAL WAYS TO END UP
ACCUSING BAXTER AND DUNBAR OF THE
MURDER.  THERE ARE ALSO MORE PUZZLES
TO SOLVE, BUT THIS IS ALL THAT IS
NECESSARY TO PUT TOGETHER AN AIR-TIGHT
CASE AGAINST THEM.  IF YOU HAVE OTHER
METHODS OF SOLVING DEADLINE, LET US
KNOW!
