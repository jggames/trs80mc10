Well,  this  one,  like  its' predecessor, MADVENTURE, is a tough
sucker. If you are after hints, this ain't the place!  This  will
be a straightforward walk- through.

If you need hints, try the following: 

1.  When you first enter the castle (N), you meet a rabbit. 'LOOK
RABBIT' and then 'APOLOGIZE' for being late. This will  give  you
one important clue. 

2.  Get the singing sword from the trophy room and 'LISTEN' to it
in every room  you  enter.  This  will  give  you  a  great  many
different clues/hints. 

Now for the walk-through.... 

(Break out if you don't want the answers!)

OK, now you are by  the  pool  and  you  should  wait  until  the
