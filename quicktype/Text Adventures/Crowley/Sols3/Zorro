First off alot of these cracks seem to
have alot of errors in them but thats
not my problem. Find a good copy. Also
you might want to use the cheat version
of this game since you will probably
screw up alot.

The first thing that you need to do
when you start is get your girlfriend's
handkerchief which will land on the
end of the well. just climb the vine
and get it. Next climb down the ladder
and get to the edge of the landing.
You'll see 3 balls bobbing in the
water. You have to get to the first
ball so jump and get onto it. Once on,
push the joystick down so that you
can move to the right side of the ball.
Then jump up onto the handrail and 
move to the other side. Now jump down
to the third ball on the right (this
is a bitch), and get onto the bottom
right hand side of the screen . Now
go onto the next screen and get to
the bottom where there will be a hole.
Go down the hole and get the plant
at the bottom of the screen. Carry
the plant back up to the screen above
you. Go up to the ball at the top of
the screen and push it. When it stops
moving, put Zorro and the plant on the
scale and wait till the ball raises the
gate and you get your extra points. Now
the fun part! Do everything again back-
wards and get back out of the well. Now
go to the next screen and skip it,
going onto the next one. Climb the tree
and get the boot. Now go to the next
screen and get the key and stick it on
the right side of the couch. Climb the
ladder and when you jump on the couch
you must get the key. Carry the key to
the next screen (screen with graveyard)
and jump to the top of the building and
back onto the last screen where you got
the key and open the door. Now go to
the painting and behind the painting
is a bottle. Get the bottle and carry
it to the bottom of the screen and give
it to the bartender on the next screen
(you go left at the bottom) and he will
pass out. Jump on his stomach and get
to the top of the screen where you can
fight the guard. DON'T KILL HIM, just
force him so that he falls off onto
the chandilier (Did I spell that
right?). Now climb down the ladder and
get the wine glass at the bottom. Climb
back out and go get the key again and
open up the door and now there will
be a branding iron instead of the
bottle. Take the branding iron to the
very first screen with the gell, and
get Zorro to the top. Then go to the
right and fall off to the bottom of
the screen (you are on the screen with
the cow now). Stick the iron in the
forge and jump up and down on the air
cusion till the iron turns red. Now get
the iron and stick it into the cow
before it cools. Now climb to the top
of the screen and cross on the
handrail, fall to the bottom of the
screen and get the horseshoe. Now
repeat getting the key and opening the
door where there will be a bell (I know
this is a pain in the ass but it must
be done!). Now go to the church (build
ing next to the graveyard) and stick
the bell in the belltower. Now go
get the key again (*sigh*), open the
door, and get the second bell and stick
it in the belltower. Now climb the
ladder that appeared while you hung
the bells and then get all the money in
the money bag.  Now keep following the
bags of money until you come to a room
where there is a ladder going up
blocked by three pictures of the horse-
shoe, cup, and boot. Go up the ladder
and then you are in the prison. Free
all the prisinors without getting shot.
Then climb the human staircase on the
left side of the wall. Then run past
the dude with the gun off to the left
side of the screen. Now get the girl
and YOU WIN!!!!!! (If your copy doesn't
crash!)

I apologize that this was written in
40 columns however my Apple Writer
bombed on me. If you have any
questions, you can leave me mail on any
of the boards mentioned in this Doc or
lot's of others that I am on.

One thing I should say is that this
game is a BITCH!

Talk to you later,
