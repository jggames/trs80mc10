ROOM 1
I am hanging on to a hand hold at the only entrance to the ship.
An open airlock leads beyond my line of sight.
ROOM 2
I am now in the airlock. There is a door here that apparently leads into the
ship.
Next to the door is a panel of three buttons, blue, black, and green.
ROOMS
I am in what is apparently an empty room.
S=1: E=1: W=1
ROOM 4
I am in a very large room. There is some sort of pentangular electronic device in the center, but I can't figure out what it is.
Toward the eastern wall there is a very large hologram.
S=1: W=1
ROOM 5
I am in a large room with a pedestal in the center. Some sort of destructive device seems to be planted in the ceiling.
N=1
ROOM 6
This large room has no distinguishing characteristics.
N=1: S=1: E=1
ROOM 7
This room is quite large. In the center there is some sort of pedestal.
Next to the door there are three buttons, blue, black, and green.
N=1
ROOM 8
I am in a long passageway. Something resembling footprints is visible in the dust leading north.
N=1: S=1
ROOM 9
I have reached a crossroads in the passageway. There are footprints (?) leading west.
S=1: E=1: W=1
ROOM 10
This is the end of the passageway. The footprints lead to the western door.
N=1: S=1:E=1: W=1
ROOM 11
I am in a very small passageway leading to a room similar to the last one.
There is a twisted, destroyed metal object in the southern room.
N=1: S=1
ROOMS 12 AND 19
This room seems to be a crew's quarters. Numerous pentangular objects that I presume to be beds.
There is some storage space here, but it has been cleared of all objects.
N=1
ROOMS 13 AND 14
This would seem to be an engine room.
There is the usual configuration of accelerator tubes associated with the Krantz/Warren hyperspace drive, although this is obviously just a variant of the K/W drive.
IF R=13 THEN E=1; IF R=14 THEN W=1
ROOM 15
I am in what has to be the main control room. To the north there is a navigation panel with numerous buttons. Behind this are a few rows of pentangular chairs, each with its own computer console.
Toward the southern end of the room is another pedestal, apparently unconnected to the control functions of the ship.
There are four doors here, two on the eastern side and two on the western side. They are paired to the north and to the south.
ROOM 16
I am in a passageway terminating at an eastern doorway.
E=1: W=1
ROOM 17
I am in a passageway.
E=1: W=1
ROOM 18
I am in a passageway. There are doors north and south.
N=1: S=1: E=1: W=1
ROOM 20
The end of the passageway.
W=1
ROOM 21
I am in what seems to be a kitchen.
There are various steel alloy tables, a scullery, convection ovens, and a large open and empty cupboard.
N=1: S=1
ROOM 22
This area seems to be an exercise room.
There is a marked-off ball(?) court, and a large swimming(?) pool, frozen solid.
N=1: S=1
ROOM 23
This is an enormous room stretching all the way to what must be the front of the ship.
There are three doors, one to the north, one to the south (to the west), and the other to the south (to the east).
N=1
ROOM 24
I am in a dramatically colorful triangular crystalline room. At the northern corner is a control panel with a slot in it.
S=1
