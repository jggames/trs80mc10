Solution for the Compukit UK101 text adventure "Galactic Hitchhiker" (1980) 
by A. Knight.

Some useful commands specific to this game:-
OPEN RUCKSACK - show inventory (player must be in possession of the rucksack)
GO START - restarts the game

To move, the GO verb must be used along with the direction typed in full.

*note1:- The directions needed to navigate the spacetran craft through space 
appear to be random and change during each play. If you get the "I can't go in 
that direction" message at this point, then just try each of the six 
directions until one of them moves the spacetran to the next stage.

Technical note:-
(Thanks to user jimmy on the stardot forums for the original information on 
this)
Terminal width should be set to 46 before playing the game. For example by 
entering BASIC using "(C)old Start". This causes it to run in the intended 16 
row mode. Otherwise, it will run with only 10 rows visible and some sentences 
will scroll off the screen making them unable to be read. After setting 
terminal width to 46, the machine can then be reset and enter the monitor to 
press L to then load the game from tape.
