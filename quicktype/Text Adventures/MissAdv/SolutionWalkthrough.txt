Solution... of the Mission Adventure game

You had to discover that the cave was occupied by a German soldier (green uniform), who died on July 25, 1944, as the ephemeris indicates, that is to say during the Liberation. The exploration of the central corridor to the north is only possible with a means of lighting. This one is discovered by searching the uniform: a box of matches is there. Each match has a lifetime corresponding to three actions or moves. Then you had to strike a new match to see clearly. In one of the rooms, a painting is visible. As is often the case in reality, there is a safe behind it. The order to remove the painting makes the safe appear. However, you still have to open it.

Looking at the safe, you could see that it has a dial. The combination of the safe was written on a sheet of paper, slipped into the book placed in the cupboard (when leafing through the book, the paper falls out). The letters accompanying the numbers were the initials of the words "right" and "left"... in German (rechts and links). You could therefore turn the button of the safe to the right, to the left then to the right again, the number of notches indicated on the sheet providing the combination. And this, after having reset it. As the title of the book found in the cupboard suggested, it was a safe with hydraulic protection. Indeed, the bottom of the safe is like the plate of a scale, capable of knowing at any time what weight it supports. As soon as it detects a difference in weight compared to that initially indicated, it triggers the fall of a gate which condemns forever the intersection near the entrance. Grid which, in turn, triggers the opening of a hatch as soon as one tries to force it.

Cutting the Lines Several readers have rightly pointed out to us — after having tried in vain to type in the listings for the adventure game and checkers (J & S micro of n°29) — that their machine did not accept 255 characters at the sequence of a single instruction number. It is therefore necessary to cut the lines and to include each of the sections under a different line number. Two cases can arise: simple instructions and tests. Simple instructions can be split into as many lines as there are instructions separated by “:”. For example: 345 A = 2: Z 3: PRINT "ACTION —" T can become 345 A = 2. 346 Z = 3. 347 PRINT "ACTION -" T. Care must be taken when it comes to testing , i.e. lines of instructions where there is an IF THEN, because if what follows the IF is verified, then everything after the THEN will be carried out. If the condition following the IF does not hold, then nothing following the THEN will be read, and the program's read pointer will jump directly to the next line. You must therefore split the test in two, or even divide it into as many successive tests as necessary so as not to exceed your capacity of signs per line. Let's take the following example: IF A = ​​2 THEN B = 3 : C = 4 : D = 5 :.../... Z = 27. This test modifying the value of all the variables from B to Z will be much too long for one line of instructions. So you can do: 340 IF A = ​​2 THEN B = 3 : C = 4 : GOTO 350 345 GOTO 1000 (case where A is different from 2) 350 IF A = ​​2 THEN D = 8

5: E = 6: GOTO 360 355 GOTO 1000 Another way to proceed, this one faster, by reversing the test:
350 IF A < > 2 THEN 1000
360 B = 3: C = 4: D = 5: F=6
370 G=7: H=8: I=9: J=10 etc. 

If A = 2, the pointer does not jump to 1000 and reads all lines that follow the test. Reversing the test is often the most practical procedure. NOTICE NOTICE NOTICE Adventure game on Commodore Philippe Peltier, from Juan-Les-Pins, tells us that owners of Commodore (Pet, Vie. 64) must very slightly modify the program proposed in J & S n°29, page 44 to respect the syntax of the Commodore, otherwise it is guaranteed to crash. It is particularly necessary on this machine to concatenate (paste!) a space at the end of the string A$, otherwise MID$ (A$, I, 1) will cause a “BAD SUSCRIPT ERROR” when it reaches its maximum value. On the other hand, there is memory loss of the loop pointer because of the ON T GOTO in line 1 100. Here is the remedy proposed by Philippe Peltier: 000 IFX=OTHEN370 1010 00SuB1230 1020 IFY.OTHEN370 1030 011SUB1300 1>340 GOT0370 1050 REM======== 1060 IFRIOHT$KR$,U="3"THENF=1 1077 1071 RṢ. -R$+" 1020 1090 IFEe=CHR$(32)ORE$=CHR4(39)THENT=T+1 ri0T01130 1100 ONTOOT01130,1120 1110 Ve-VS+1 ; e:GOT01130 1120 Ne-,N.e+B $ 1130 I=I+1 1131 IFI
