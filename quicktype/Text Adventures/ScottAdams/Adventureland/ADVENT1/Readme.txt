"A D V E N T U R L A N D"

By Scott Adams

THE OBJECT OF YOUR ADVENTURE IS TO FIND TREASURES AND RETURN THEM TO THE PROPER PLACE FOR YOU TO ACCUMULATE POINTS. I'M YOUR CLONE. GIVE ME COMMANDS THAT CONSIST OF A VERB & NOUN, I.E. GO EAST, TAKE KEY, CLIMB TREE,SAVE GAME, TAKE INVENTORY, FIND AXE, ETC. YOU'LL NEED SOME SPECIAL ITEMS TO DO SOME THINGS, BUT I'M SURE THAT YOU'LL BE A GOOD ADVENTURER AND FIGURE THESE THINGS OUT (WHICH IS MOST OF THE FUN OF THIS GAME).

NOTE THAT GOING IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION WON'T ALWAYS GET YOU BACK TO WHERE YOU WERE.

HAPPY ADVENTURING!!!
