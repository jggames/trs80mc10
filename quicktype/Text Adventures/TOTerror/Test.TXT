Replying here so it doesn’t get buried too deep.

I’ve OCR’d and fixed (to the best of my abilities) Tunnels of Terror as well. The game is winnable, and I’ve included a map – but I think there’s some errors left in the original listing – I couldn’t figure out how to get rid of the vampire, and the final challenge was a rather silly battle of attrition between two people who’ve never hit anyone in their life – I assume something more should happen there based on the code.

There’s also a room that seems to warp you with no warning, a scroll that should disappear but doesn’t, a magic spell that doesn’t seem to be used at all despite being mentioned in the HELP… if anyone wants to try and fix it more, you’re very welcome.
