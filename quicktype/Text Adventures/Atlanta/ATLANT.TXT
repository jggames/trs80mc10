"Voyage to Atlantis" by Greg Hassett

  This short Basic-Adventure appeared at first in the early 80s in a publication
called "The Captain80 Book of Basic Adventures" (as far as I can guess - un-
fortunately I lost the title-page). This book contained some blurbs about
playing and writing of text adventures, a terrible adventure generator and 18
textadventures in Basic, one of them was the Basic-version of Scott Adams'
"Adventureland". (I think this is the Version which appeared later on the
PC-SIG Disc, cf. ftp.gmd.de). This program was one of five written by Greg 
Hassett who was at that time a fifteen year old from Chelmsford, Massachu-
setts.

  I decided on transscribing this Program to Qbasic "aus einer Bierlaune 
heraus". Because of Greg's stylish Basic, the adventure made really no problems.
But I did not much playtesting etc. So I can't guarantee that the adventure
is bug-free. I wrote it downin an afternoon or two just to have some fun. If
you can find any use for it, go ahead!
