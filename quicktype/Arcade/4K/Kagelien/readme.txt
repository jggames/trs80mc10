5. KAGERIEN (arrangement)
Move yourself in 4 directions with the cursor keys so that you do not hit an enemy or a bomb (*).
Please take all the unpleasant. Enemies and bombs are displayed only on the left screen, and diamonds are displayed only on the right screen.
	It will not be. If you press the space key when the score is 100 points or more, you will lose 100 points and the enemy's movement
You can pause it. When the score reaches 500 points, one person increases, and after that, 1,000 points
One person will be added each time. In addition, there is a time limit for each surface, and even if this becomes 0, the number of people will decrease by one.
I will. When all of you die, the game is over.

restart
In any game, if you press the space key, you can play the same game and return.
Press the key to return to the menu screen.
At the end
At first, I intended to make everything original, but in the end, more than half were transplanted.
It has become. Next, I challenged the limits of N60BASIC !? Send the game
	I would like.
