Hey Gunnar,

Here is a 10-Liner for your 2026 contest. I've included the source code (.txt) and emulator cassette file (.10) and some screen shots (.png).
I've also included a version of the source code with extra comments inserted.

The latest VMC10 Emulator can be downloaded here:

Make sure your emulator is configured for 20K (with the 16K RAM pack).
To Run the programs type CLOAD and hit Enter on the main emulator (green) screen.
Then use the Cassette menu under the File menu of the emulator to load the IDROP.C10
Then type RUN and hit the Enter key.
The program uses SPACE to drop and the O and P keys to steer your parachutist.  Use ENTER to restart.

For additional instructions, just LIST the program after loading.
You will see some REM statements listed after lines line 0-9 (the program)
