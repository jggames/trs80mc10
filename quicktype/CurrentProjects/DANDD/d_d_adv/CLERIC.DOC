	There are two classes of spells: Those that last for a while,
and those that don't.  In each of these classes are two further
distinctions: Spells that are meant for use in combat, and those that
aren't.

	Combat spells are flagged with a '*'.  These may or may not work,
depending on the relative levels of the spell caster and his target.  If
the opponent is a great deal more powerful than the Cleric, it is very
highly resistant to the latter's magicking.  The formula for spell
efficacy varies from spell to spell, and contains a random factor.

	Each spell is described briefly, and is labeled 'Combat,' if ap-
plicable.  In addition, each is labeled either 'Immediate' or 'Duration.'
The former do whatever it is that they do RIGHT NOW, while the latter's
effects take a little while to disperse.

	The next page contains the Spell Tables.  The four pages
following describe the spells themselves, one level per page.

*Finger of Death:	Imbues the caster's finger (which is immediately

			diameter with great rapidity, catching and destroying
			any attacking monster.

Heal:			Totally cures ALL damage the caster has incurred.
