SINCE THEPROGR,AM IS FAIRLY SMALL" COMPARED TO THE BIG CHESS-PLAYING PROGRAMS, IT ISN'T HARD TO BEAT. IN FACT, I'VE BEAT IT 3 TIMES OUT OF 3, AND I DON'T CONSIDER MYSELF A VERY GOOD PLAYER.

WE WILL NOT AUTOMATICALLY SEND OUT THESE IMPROVEMENTS" AND IF A NEW TAPE OR DOCUMENTATION IS REQUIRED" THE CUSTOMER IS EXPECTED TO PAY THE USUAL PRICE OF 56. CAl,.FIFORNIA RESIDENTS PLEASE ADO 6~.
