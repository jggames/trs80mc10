Bob Alexander has discovered another Star Trek game than the one most people know about, but which was a contemporary of that classic game.  He's reconstructed the source, which I have used for this port to the TRS-80 Micro Color Computer.
Here's Bob's video: https://youtu.be/1Q_4k41Y7eM

The game can be played online using a Javascript emulator for the TRS-80 MC-10 here:

Select TOTREK from the Cassette directory and type RUN in the Main (green) screen and hit Enter.
