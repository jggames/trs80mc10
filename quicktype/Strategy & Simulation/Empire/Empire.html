The world
on which the game takes place is a square rectangle containing cities,
land, and water.  Cities are used to build armies, planes, and ships
which can move across the world destroying enemy pieces, exploring,
and capturing more cities.  The objective of the game is to destroy
all the enemy pieces, and capture all the cities.</p><p>The world is a rectangle 60 by 100 squares on a side.  The world
consists of sea (.), land (+), uncontrolled cities (*),
computer-controlled cities (X), and cities that you control
(O).</p><p>The world is displayed on the player's screen during movement.
(On terminals with small screens, only a portion of the world is shown
at any one time.)  Each piece is represented by a unique character on
the map.  With a few exceptions, you can only have one piece on a
given location.  On the map, you are shown only the 8 squares adjacent
to your units.  This information is updated before and during each of
your moves.  The map displays the most recent information
known.</p><p>The game starts by assigning you one city and the
computer one city.  Cities can produce new pieces.  Every
city that you own produces more pieces for you according
to the cost of the desired piece.  The typical play of the
game is to issue the Automove command until you decide
to do something special.  During movement in each round,
the player is prompted to move each piece that does not
otherwise have an assigned function.</p><p>Map coordinates are 4-digit numbers.  The first two
digits are the row, the second two digits are the
column.</p></div><div class="refsect1"><a name="pieces"></a><h2>PIECES</h2><p>The pieces are as follows:</p><div class="informaltable"><table class="informaltable" border="1"><colgroup><col align="center" class="c1"><col align="center" class="c2"><col align="center" class="c3"><col align="center" class="c4"><col align="center" class="c5"><col align="center" class="c6"><col align="center" class="c7"></colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left">Piece</td><td align="center">You</td><td align="center">Enemy</td><td align="right">Moves</td><td align="right">Hits</td><td align="right">Str</td><td align="center">Cost</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Army</td><td align="center">A</td><td align="center">a</td><td align="right">1</td><td align="right">1</td><td align="right">1</td><td align="center">5(6)</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Fighter</td><td align="center">F</td><td align="center">f</td><td align="right">8</td><td align="right">1</td><td align="right">1</td><td align="center">10(12)</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Patrol Boat</td><td align="center">P</td><td align="center">p</td><td align="right">4</td><td align="right">1</td><td align="right">1</td><td align="center">15(18)</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Destroyer</td><td align="center">D</td><td align="center">d</td><td align="right">2</td><td align="right">3</td><td align="right">1</td><td align="center">20(24)</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Submarine</td><td align="center">S</td><td align="center">s</td><td align="right">2</td><td align="right">2</td><td align="right">3</td><td align="center">20(24)</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Troop Transport</td><td align="center">T</td><td align="center">t</td><td align="right">2</td><td align="right">1</td><td align="right">1</td><td align="center">30(36)</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Aircraft Carrier</td><td align="center">C</td><td align="center">c</td><td align="right">2</td><td align="right">8</td><td align="right">1</td><td align="center">30(36)</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Battleship</td><td align="center">B</td><td align="center">b</td><td align="right">2</td><td align="right">10</td><td align="right">2</td><td align="center">40(48)</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Satellite</td><td align="center">Z</td><td align="center">z</td><td align="right">10</td><td align="right">--</td><td align="right">--</td><td align="center">50(60)</td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>The second column shows the map representation for your
units.</p><p>The third shows the representations of enemy units.</p><p>Moves is the number of squares that the unit can move in a
single round.</p><p>Hits is the amount of damage a unit can take before it
is destroyed.</p><p>Strength is the amount of damage a unit can inflict upon an
enemy during each round of an attack.</p><p>Cost is the number of rounds needed for a city to produce
the piece.</p><p>The number in parenthesis is the cost for a city to
produce the first unit.</p><p>Each piece has certain advantages associated with it that
can make it useful.  One of the primary strategic aspects
of this game is deciding which pieces will be produced
and in what quantities.</p><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Armies</em></span> can only move on land, and
are the only piece that can move on land.  Only armies can capture
cities.  This means that you must produce armies in order to win the
game.  Armies have a 50% chance of capturing a city when they attack.
(Attacking one's own city results in the army's destruction.  Armies
that move onto the sea will drown.  Armies can attack objects at sea,
but even if they win, they will drown.)  Armies can be carried by
troop transports.  If an army is moved onto a troop transport, then
whenever the transport is moved, the army will be moved with the
transport.  You cannot attack any piece at sea while on a
transport.</p><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Fighters</em></span> move over both land and
sea, and they move 8 squares per round.  Their high speed and great
mobility make fighters ideal for exploring.  However, fighters must
periodically land at user-owned cities for refueling.  A fighter can
travel 32 squares without refueling.  Fighters are also shot down if
they attempt to fly over a city which is not owned by the user.</p><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Patrol boats</em></span> are fast but lightly
armored.  Therefore they are useful for patrolling ocean waters and
exploring.  In an attack against a stronger boat, however, patrol
boats will suffer heavy casualties.</p><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Destroyers</em></span> are fairly heavily
armored and reasonably quick to produce.  Thus they are useful for
destroying enemy transports which may be trying to spread the enemy
across the face of the world.</p><p>When a <span class="emphasis"><em>submarine</em></span> scores a hit, 3
hits are exacted instead of 1.  Thus submarines can inflict heavy
damage in a fight against heavily armored boats.  Notice that healthy
submarines will typically defeat healthy destroyers two-thirds of the
time.  However, a submarine will defeat a fighter about two-thirds of
the time, while a destroyer will defeat a fighter three-fourths of the
time.</p><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Troop transports</em></span> are the only
pieces that can carry armies.  A maximum of six armies can be carried
by a transport.  On any world containing a reasonable amount of water,
transports will be a critical resource in winning the game.  Notice
that the weakness of transports implies they need protection from
stronger ships.</p><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Aircraft carriers</em></span> are the only
ships that can carry fighters.  Carriers carry a maximum of the number
of hits left of fighters.  Fighters are refueled when they land on a
carrier.</p><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Battleships</em></span> are similar to
destroyers except that they are much stronger.</p><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Satellites</em></span> are only useful for reconnaissance.  They can not
be attacked.  They are launched in a random diagonal orbit, and
stay up for 50 turns.  They can see one square farther than other
objects.</p><p>All ships can move only on the sea.  Ships can also dock in a
user-owned city.  Docked ships have damage repaired at the
rate of 1 hit per turn.  Ships which have suffered a lot
of damage will move more slowly.</p><p>Because of their ability to be repaired, ships with lots of hits
such as Carriers and Battleships have an additional advantage.  After
suffering minor damage while destroying enemy shipping, these ships
can sail back to port and be quickly repaired before the enemy has
time to replenish her destroyed shipping.</p><p>The following table gives the probability that the piece listed
on the side will defeat the piece listed at the top in a battle.
(The table assumes that both pieces are undamaged.)</p><div class="informaltable"><table class="informaltable" border="1"><colgroup><col align="center" class="c1"><col align="center" class="c2"><col align="center" class="c3"><col align="center" class="c4"><col align="center" class="c5"><col align="center" class="c6"></colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="center"> </td><td align="left">AFPT</td><td align="center">D</td><td align="center">S</td><td align="center">C</td><td align="center">B</td></tr><tr><td align="left">AFPT</td><td align="center">50.0%</td><td align="center">12.5%</td><td align="center">25.0%</td><td align="center">00.391%</td><td align="center">00.0977%</td></tr><tr><td align="left">D</td><td align="center">87.5%</td><td align="center">50.0%</td><td align="center">25.0%</td><td align="center">05.47%</td><td align="center">00.537%</td></tr><tr><td align="left">S</td><td align="center">75.0%</td><td align="center">75.0%</td><td align="center">50.0%</td><td align="center">31.3%</td><td align="center">06.25%</td></tr><tr><td align="left">C</td><td align="center">99.6%</td><td align="center">94.5%</td><td align="center">68.7%</td><td align="center">50.0%</td><td align="center">04.61%</td></tr><tr><td align="left">B</td><td align="center">99.9%</td><td align="center">99.5%</td><td align="center">93.8%</td><td align="center">95.4%</td><td align="center">50.0%</td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>Notice, however, that when a ship has been damaged, the odds of
being defeated can go up quite a bit.  For example, a healthy
submarine has a 25% chance of defeating a battleship that has
had one hit of damage done to it, and a healthy submarine has
a 50% chance of defeating a carrier which has suffered two hits
of damage.</p></div><div class="refsect1"><a name="movement_functions"></a><h2>MOVEMENT FUNCTIONS</h2><p>There are a variety of movement functions.  The movement functions
of pieces can be specified in user mode and edit mode.
Cities can have movement functions set for each type of piece.
When a movement function for a type of pieces is set for a city,
then every time that type of piece appears in the city, the piece
will acquire that movement function.  Be forewarned that moving
loaded transports or loaded carriers into a city can have undesirable
side effects.</p><p>Normally, when a movement
function has been specified, the piece will continue moving according to
that function until one of the following happen:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>An enemy piece or unowned city appears next to the piece.  In this case
the piece will be completely awoken, unless its movement function has
been set to a specific destination.
Armies on ships and pieces inside
cities will not be awoken if the enemy piece is gone by the time it is
their turn to move.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>You explicitly awaken the piece.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>The piece can no longer move in accordance with its programmed function.
In this case, the piece will awaken <span class="emphasis"><em>temporarily</em></span>.  You will be asked
to move the piece at which time you may awaken it.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>The piece is a fighter which has just enough fuel (plus a small reserve)
to get to the nearest city.
In this case,
the piece will awaken completely, unless its movement function has
been set to a specific destination, or its movement function has been
set to <span class="emphasis"><em>land</em></span>.</p></li></ul></div><p>The rationale behind this complexity is that fighters must be awoken
completely before they are out of range of a city
to prevent one from accidentally forgetting to waken the
fighter and then watching it fly off to its doom.  However, it is presumed
that when a path is set for the fighter, the fighter is not in danger of
running out of fuel.</p><p>Pieces do not completely awaken when their function has been set to a
destination because it is slightly time consuming to reset the destination,
but very simple (one keystroke) to wake the piece.</p><p>The movement functions are:</p><div class="variablelist"><dl class="variablelist"><dt><span class="term"><span class="emphasis"><em>Attack</em></span></span></dt><dd><p>This function applies only to armies.  When this function is set,
the army will move toward the nearest enemy city, unowned city, or
enemy army.  This is useful when fighting off an invading enemy or
taking over a new continent.  When an army is set to this mode,
it will also explore nearby territory.  This tends to make
the "grope" movement mode pretty useless.</p></dd><dt><span class="term"><span class="emphasis"><em>Awake</em></span></span></dt><dd><p>When pieces are awake, you will be asked for the direction in which
the piece should move on each turn.</p></dd><dt><span class="term"><span class="emphasis"><em>Fill</em></span></span></dt><dd><p>This function applies to carriers and transports.  When this function is
specified, these ships sleep until they have been filled with fighters or
armies respectively.</p></dd><dt><span class="term"><span class="emphasis"><em>Grope</em></span></span></dt><dd><p>This function causes a piece to explore.  The piece heads toward
the nearest unseen square of the map on each of its moves.  Some
attempt is made to explore in an optimal fashion.</p></dd><dt><span class="term"><span class="emphasis"><em>Land</em></span></span></dt><dd><p>This function applies to fighters and causes the fighter to head toward
the nearest transport or carrier.</p></dd><dt><span class="term"><span class="emphasis"><em>Random</em></span></span></dt><dd><p>This movement function causes a piece to move at random to an adjacent
empty square.</p></dd><dt><span class="term"><span class="emphasis"><em>Sentry</em></span></span></dt><dd><p>This movement function puts a piece to sleep.

an unfull transport passes by, at which point the army wakes up and
boards the transport.</p></dd><dt><span class="term"><span class="emphasis"><em>Upgrade</em></span></span></dt><dd><p>This movement function only works with ships.  The ship will move
to the nearest owned city and remain there until it is repaired.</p></dd><dt><span class="term"><span class="emphasis"><em>&lt;dir&gt;</em></span></span></dt><dd><p>Pieces can be set to move in a specified direction.</p></dd><dt><span class="term"><span class="emphasis"><em>&lt;dest&gt;</em></span></span></dt><dd><p>Pieces can be set to move toward a specified square.  In this movement
mode, pieces take a shortest path toward the destination.  Pieces moving
in accordance with this function prefer diagonal moves that explore
territory.  Because of this, the movement of the piece may be
non-intuitive.</p></dd></dl></div><p>As examples of how to use these movement functions, typically
when I have a new city on a continent, I set the Army function of the
city to <span class="emphasis"><em>attack</em></span>.  Whenever an army is
produced, it merrily goes off on its way exploring the continent and
moving towards unowned cities or enemy armies or cities.</p><p>I frequently set the ship functions for cities that are far from the
front to automatically move ships towards the front.</p><p>When I have armies on a continent, but there is nothing to
explore or attack, I move the army to the shore and use the <span class="emphasis"><em>transport</em></span> function to have that army hop aboard
the first passing transport.</p></div><div class="refsect1"><a name="commands"></a><h2>COMMANDS</h2><p>There are three command modes.  The first of these is "command mode".
In this mode, you give commands that affect the game as a whole.

edit the functions of your pieces and examine various portions of
the map.</p><p>All commands are one character long.  The full mnemonic names

find that the computer is immensely easy to beat.  Here are some
ideas you can try that may make the game more interesting.</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>Give the computer one or more extra cities before starting
    the game.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Try playing the game with a low smoothness value (try using the
    -s2 or even -s0 option).</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>When starting the game, the program will ask you what difficulty
    level you want.  Here "difficulty level" is a misnomer.  To compute
    a difficulty level, the program looks at each continent and counts
    the number of cities on the continents.  A high "difficulty level"
    gives the computer a large continent with many cities, while the
    user gets a small continent with few cities.  A low "difficulty level"
    has the opposite effect.  It may be the case that the computer will
    play better when the "difficulty level" is low.  The reason for this
    is that the computer is forced to move armies to multiple continents
    early in the game.</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="refsect1"><a name="history"></a><h2>HISTORY</h2><p>According to 
<a class="ulink" href="http://www.classicempire.com/history.html" target="_top">
A Brief History of Empire </a>, the ancestral game was written by
Walter Bright sometime in the early 1970s while he was a student at
Caltech.  A copy leaked out of Caltech and was ported to DEC's VAX/VMS
from the TOPS-10/20 FORTRAN sources available sometime around fall
1979.  Craig Leres found the source code on a DECUS tape in 1983 and
added support for different terminal types.</p><p>Ed James got hold of the sources at Berkeley and converted
portions of the code to C, mostly to use curses for the screen
handling.  He published his modified sources on the net in December
1986.  Because this game ran on VMS machines for so long, it has been
known as VMS Empire.</p><p>In 1987 Chuck Simmons at Amdahl reverse-engineered the program
and wrote a version completely in C.  In doing so, he modified the
computer strategy, the commands, the piece types, many of the piece
attributes, and the algorithm for creating maps.</p><p>The various versions of this game were ancestral to later and
better-known 4X (expand/explore/exploit/exterminate) games, including
Civilization (1990) and Master of Orion (1993).</p><p>In 1994 Eric Raymond colorized the game.</p></div><div class="refsect1"><a name="files"></a><h2>FILES</h2><div class="variablelist"><dl class="variablelist"><dt><span class="term"><span class="emphasis"><em>empsave.dat</em></span></span></dt><dd><p>holds a backup of the game.
