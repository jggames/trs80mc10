Games and other software for the TRS-80 MC-10

These programs can be used with the Quicktype feature of the emulator.  (Be sure to type NEW before Quicktyping).

Most require the use of the 16K RAM expander.  With the emulator, 
Configure >> Memory... and select these two options:
* RAM Normal (as sold in stores) 
* +16K RAM Expansion (as sold in stores)

If you have a real MC10, you'll need a real MC10 16K RAM expander.  Buy it on EBay.


To use one of these programs with a real MC-10, you'd have to Quicktype it into the emulator, then CSAVE it to make a .c10 file.  Then, use the C10TOWAV utility (in the Tools directory) to make a WAV file.  Finally, this WAV file can be played back to an audio-connected MC-10, or it could be played back and recorded by an audio-connected cassette recorder.

NOTE:  Some of these files have been separated from their information and other useful files.  If you're interested in finding out more about a particular file, go see its "downloaded from" website!


Enjoy.
